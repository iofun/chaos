	<h1 class="post-title">Variations in the control process</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Mon 24 April 2017</span>
	<p>The control process of an organization can be implemented in a number of ways.</p>
<p>One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.</p>
<p>A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: </p>
<p>["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]</p>
<p>Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.</p>
<p>The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.</p>
<p>The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.</p>
<p>He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.</p>
<p>The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.</p>
<p>As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.</p>
<p>In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.</p>
<p>The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.</p>
<p>Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases nature itself.</p>
<p>As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.</p>
<p>As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.</p>
