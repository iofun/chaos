    <h1 class="post-title">Achieving Coordination</h1>
    <p>Having covered the essential core of distribution let us now consider how several loops are connected to provide that synchronization of effort we think of as coordination.</p>
<h4>Programmed links</h4>
<p>If the process had given instruction to report immediately on completion of the task, this instruction facilitates linking the completed act with the next one. Through an information transfer, we call this a programmed link.</p>
<p>The supervisor node, of course may detect that something is wrong through another control cycle. It can then take corrective action by including or adding into this programmed link or perhaps by attacking on the more difficult problem of human apathetic attitudes and motivation his units could display.</p>
<h4>Progression of goals</h4>
<p>Organizations have progression of goals which result from a division of work.</p>
<p>A subdivide goal becomes the task of a process contained within a specialized organizational unit.</p>
<p>This nesting of goals is contained as part of the core organizational  means-ends chain.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the hierarchy of control loops which are connected with the progression of goals may be handle in number of ways, regardless of how the elements are allocated, the important factor is that all elements must be provided for in some way. Hence, our model supplies an extremely useful tool in analyzing complex control situations by telling us what basic functions bust occur and in what sequence, even though initially we have no idea as to where or how they are executed in the organization.</p>
<h4>Feedback and Goal formation</h4>
<p>The feedback loop containing information about organizational performance and conditions leads to definition of subunit goals or standards. It's important to show how a situation in one area could lead to modifications in a number of organizational units at higher levels.</p>
<p>This even result in reformulating the basic goals of organizations. Feedback is essential to adequate goal formation.</p>
<p>This leads us to an important point which, when stated without the type of development presented, appears to be a somewhat mystical statement; namely, organizations automatically take actions to bring about their continuity or to perpetuate themselves. Of course there are times when organizations do not change goals and do go out of existence. Many, however, shift to those goals feedback defines as possible; feedback leading to goal redefinition is one of the basic ways by which organizational survival is achieved.</p>
<h4>Time Discrepancies</h4>
<p>Another problem that can exist with control is that the feedback of information on performance takes so long it became impossible to correct performance.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of time which should be mentioned, the time horizon of people in an organization gets progressively shorter as we come down in a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Hence, by taking into account the perceptions of organizations members along with the time during which wortk is being performed on a prohect we can begin to define a time period within wich feedback must occur if adequate corrective action is to be taken.</p>
