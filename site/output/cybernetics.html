    <p>Systems are so extraordinarily complex that it is difficult to deal with them in any detailed fashion.</p>
<p>We are likely to find analyses which discuss the performance of organizational elements in handling the control process but relatively little discussion of how this is accomplished.</p>
<p>Control systems are to a considerable degree influenced by basic human organizational phenomena, principal among them are perception formation, motivation and communications.</p>
<p>The basic elements of the control process are few in number:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gathering of data about performance by a sensor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison of performance with standard by a discriminator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a difference between performance and standard is noted, two courses of action are likely to be taking by a decision maker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertake corrective action which will bring performance back into line with standards perhaps by selecting or developing a new process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct information about this difference to a goal setter for the establishment of new goals or the redefinition of old ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When these elements exists, there is control through self-regulation of whatever entity contains them.</p>
<p>The elements, however, may be allocated in a number of ways within the entity.</p>
<p>They may all be performed by one person or each element may be performed by a different person or for that matter, by different departments.</p>
<p>As the work of carrying the control cycle is divided further, coordination of this effort becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Control as we have been seen it is one type of system, we observe how control has many of the same properties as systems in general; numerous systems interblocked in many ways.</p>
<p>One such way may be seen when there are hierarchies of systems paralleling progression of goals.</p>
<p>There are also systems within systems and loops within the loops. Since control is also a system, it can influence other systems and in turn be influenced by them.</p>
<p>Looking at control as a particular type of system make us appreciate how extraordinarily complex a topic it is, and at the same time gives us an extremely valuable approach to this subject.</p>
