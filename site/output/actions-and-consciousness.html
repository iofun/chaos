    <h1 class="post-title">Actions and Consciousness</h1>
    <p>Our emphasis is on people in organizations where managers have to make decisions even through their knowledge and concepts may be wrong or inadequate.</p>
<p>As generalizations are made about what takes place in organizations, we shall often be talking about the decision processes that organizational members engage in or the sequence of factors which lead to a particular behavior.</p>
<p>We talk about the possible actions a person may take on recepipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.</p>
<p>We talk about choossing amount the courses of accepting the order competly, protesting, protesting and raiisng an alternative, or leavng the organization.</p>
<p>It sometimes appers as if there were a basic assumption that people consicosly bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsicusly that on other occasions he perhaps conducts consciously? We hardly know...</p>
<p>We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thougth that I would act like that under those circumstances.</p>
<p>In saying this the individual indicates that he saw other opportunities and that, through some process unobservable to him he decided among them and chose on that came from elsewhere that his own conscious thought.</p>
<p>The distiontion between conscious and onconscious thought are by no means easy to determine, and for our purposes, it is not usually necessary to make them.</p>
<p>Considerng the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence at the moment, it seems reasonable to aconduct our analysis at the level at which both machines and humans do make decisions, wihout taling into account whether the choices and decisions processes are consicious or not.</p>
<p>Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptial tools for analysis. As ith any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.</p>
