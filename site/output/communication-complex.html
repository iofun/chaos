    <p>One sector, semantics, concerns it-self with the meaning of symbols and words.</p>
<p>Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.</p>
<p>In communications such as the written or spoken words, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.</p>
<p>A third part of communication is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.</p>
<p>Each of the approaches to computer communication represents an enormous field of study with many subdivisions.</p>
<p>The central question here is cern in with a communication system. Much of the communications that occur in organizations primarly involve people, and many times the specifics illustrations of the general system pertain to communications among individuals.</p>
<h3>Channeling Claude E. Shannon</h3>
<p>Shannon originally developed his model of communications while working on problems of telephone communications.</p>
<p>Note that analytical and highly mathematical rather than empirical, these ideas have been the foundation for many concepts grouped under the title of "Information Theory" the important aspects of these concepts are that they have been found application in analyzing not only problems in mechanical systems with links and leavers and in social systems with human beings.</p>
<p>Shannon's model is a general model of communication useful wherever there is a flow of information.</p>
<p>The block labeled Sender, identifies the place, person, or equipment, which produces the message and sends it out.</p>
<p>For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a Channel.</p>
<p>Channels can take many forms; a simple illustration is telephone wires. Channels may also be radio waves, light waves, sound waves, pieces of paper, etc.</p>
<p>We are concerned hare not only with the various forms of channels but also the ways in which organizations create them or facilitate or impede their creation.</p>
