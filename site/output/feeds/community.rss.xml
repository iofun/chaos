&lt;p&gt;The laboratory conducts multidisciplinary research in the fields of artificial intelligence, inconsistency robustness, soft real-time communications, game theory and high-performance computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a loose, sparse, distributed organization ruled by tropical cloud forest monkeys living in the jungle without a clear power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2017 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-24:variations-in-the-control-process.html</guid></item><item><title>Control Processes and Systems</title><link>https://shaos.ws/control-processes-and-systems.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Control is a word that has a number of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned with control in relation to matching performance with necessary or required conditions to obtain a purpose or objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different processes which produce control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization n a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The control process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2016-08-02:control-processes-and-systems.html</guid></item><item><title>Self-regulating systems</title><link>https://shaos.ws/self-regulating-systems.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tends towards equilibrium, we noted that parts interconnected to accomplish a purpose are identified as a system. This is a property of the system, however, there are many others occurring naturally, which have this same property called homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an organization, modern production-control techniques not only plan production schedules but also build in ways to check whether these schedules are being maintained; should there be any variation there are procedures established for corrective action which are self-regulating to keep production flowing smoothly without the higher executives getting involved in the processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already noted that organizations are complexes of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now establishing that many systems are self-regulating, or to put it directly, organizations are self-regulating.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2016-08-02:self-regulating-systems.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
