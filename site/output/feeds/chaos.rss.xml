&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made, for example a propety is noted to be too low corrective action is required: the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker that it's yet another neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the first phases are repeated unit the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit, then another action is required and the process is shut off and killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:the-control-phases.html</guid></item><item><title>Abstraction Models</title><link>https://shaos.ws/abstraction-models.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand what is happenng around us we are faced with a fundamental problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just to many facts, details and items requiring consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In approaching any situaton, the system trying to understand it, does not attempt to gather all information. Instead it selects certain facts and searchers for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of some items and ignoring of others is a process of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the abstracting fomr a real or if you will empirical situation the tings seemingly most important to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model your challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the abstracted elements, the character with the flat tire begins to connect them into a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, he weaves them into a model of the confronting situation, which we can use both to understand his plight and figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of this model would probably include, amoung other things, the flat tire, the image of the spare in the trunk, the telephone, the service station, his own forthcoming business meating, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second model would contain the telephone, the service station, and the repairman there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it concludes that it will call a cab and leave his wife to deal with the flat tire as best as she can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extraordinarily elementary models, but they serve a very practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them the main character in our illustration can see the likely consequences of various courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out these things by doing them directly by actually handling the tire and observing that we get dirty, or by calling the repairmen and waiting for him and learning that it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the model, however, we can make some reasonable predictions about what will occur and therby accept or reject the choices open to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this process of abstraction and model building we deliberately select a few items, ignore may others, and then place the items chosen in a particular relationship to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so we are intentionally ignoring facts or relationships that can influence the type of situation under study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it to select the most meaningful elements and relationships and dropout the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use abstraction skillfully know well that they neither have all the facts nor have considered all the relationships bearing on the outcome of what they are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not use the abstractions from one situation in another setting without carefully examining the fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither do we expect a model to handle all aspects of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be dealing with many abstractions and models, not with the intention of exactly mirroring the real world but with the objective of clarifying our perception of its most essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstractions and models are mechanisms for economizing both time and effort, but like any tool they must be used within their limits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:abstraction-models.html</guid></item><item><title>Waves of the Past</title><link>https://shaos.ws/waves-of-the-past.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;An indication of the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of principles of organizations; these were didactic statements of absolute and final truths which hold in all situations like a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were' in effect, the one final answer to what an organization should be or do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones migth seem to be a regression, a loss of position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it amounts to an enourmouns step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the multitud and complexity of the factors involved in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:waves-of-the-past.html</guid></item><item><title>Actions and Consciousness</title><link>https://shaos.ws/actions-and-consciousness.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Our emphasis is on people in organizations where managers have to make decisions even through their knowledge and concepts may be wrong or inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As generalizations are made about what takes place in organizations, we shall often be talking about the decision processes that organizational members engage in or the sequence of factors which lead to a particular behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the possible actions a person may take on recepipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about choossing amount the courses of accepting the order competly, protesting, protesting and raiisng an alternative, or leavng the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes appers as if there were a basic assumption that people consicosly bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsicusly that on other occasions he perhaps conducts consciously? We hardly know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thougth that I would act like that under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In saying this the individual indicates that he saw other opportunities and that, through some process unobservable to him he decided among them and chose on that came from elsewhere that his own conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distiontion between conscious and onconscious thought are by no means easy to determine, and for our purposes, it is not usually necessary to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerng the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence at the moment, it seems reasonable to aconduct our analysis at the level at which both machines and humans do make decisions, wihout taling into account whether the choices and decisions processes are consicious or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptial tools for analysis. As ith any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:actions-and-consciousness.html</guid></item><item><title>Chaos and Inconsistency</title><link>https://shaos.ws/chaos-and-inconsistency.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors make life of self-regulating systems difficult at times one is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem or bug can enter in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in     these solutions is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:chaos-and-inconsistency.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
