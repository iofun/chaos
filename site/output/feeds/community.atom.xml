&lt;p&gt;One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Achieving Coordination</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/achieving-coordination.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-28T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-09-28T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2016-09-28:/achieving-coordination.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having covered the essential core of distribution let us now consider how several loops are connected to provide that synchronization of effort we think of as coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Programmed links&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the process had given instruction to report immediately on completion of the task, this instruction facilitates linking the completed act with the next one. Through an information transfer, we call this a programmed link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supervisor node, of course may detect that something is wrong through another control cycle. It can then take corrective action by including or adding into this programmed link or perhaps by attacking on the more difficult problem of human apathetic attitudes and motivation his units could display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Progression of goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations have progression of goals which result from a division of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subdivide goal becomes the task of a process contained within a specialized organizational unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nesting of goals is contained as part of the core organizational  means-ends chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the hierarchy of control loops which are connected with the progression of goals may be handle in number of ways, regardless of how the elements are allocated, the important factor is that all elements must be provided for in some way. Hence, our model supplies an extremely useful tool in analyzing complex control situations by telling us what basic functions bust occur and in what sequence, even though initially we have no idea as to where or how they are executed in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback and Goal formation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop containing information about organizational performance and conditions leads to definition of subunit goals or standards. It's important to show how a situation in one area could lead to modifications in a number of organizational units at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This even result in reformulating the basic goals of organizations. Feedback is essential to adequate goal formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to an important point which, when stated without the type of development presented, appears to be a somewhat mystical statement; namely, organizations automatically take actions to bring about their continuity or to perpetuate themselves. Of course there are times when organizations do not change goals and do go out of existence. Many, however, shift to those goals feedback defines as possible; feedback leading to goal redefinition is one of the basic ways by which organizational survival is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Time Discrepancies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem that can exist with control is that the feedback of information on performance takes so long it became impossible to correct performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of time which should be mentioned, the time horizon of people in an organization gets progressively shorter as we come down in a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, by taking into account the perceptions of organizations members along with the time during which wortk is being performed on a prohect we can begin to define a time period within wich feedback must occur if adequate corrective action is to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Control Systems</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/control-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2016-08-02:/control-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Control is a word that has a number of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are concerned with control in relation to matching performance with necessary or required conditions to obtain a purpose or objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different processes which produce control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization in a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The control process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Self-regulating systems</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/self-regulating-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T14:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T14:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2016-08-02:/self-regulating-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tends towards equilibrium, we noted that parts interconnected to accomplish a purpose are identified as a system.

&lt;p&gt;In an organization, modern production-control techniques not only plan production schedules but also build in ways to check whether these schedules are being maintained; should there be any variation there are procedures established for corrective action which are self-regulating to keep production flowing smoothly without the higher executives getting involved in the processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already noted that organizations are complexes of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now establishing that many systems are self-regulating, or to put it directly, organizations are self-regulating.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
