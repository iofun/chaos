&lt;p&gt;Swarm in this context refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of social animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of '&lt;em&gt;swarm intelligence&lt;/em&gt;' refers to a more general set of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of systems consist typically of a population of simple bots or units interacting locally with one another and with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration comes from nature, biological systems and especially physics, including general relativity and quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how working units should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between them lead to the emergence of '&lt;em&gt;intelligent&lt;/em&gt;' global behavior, unknown to the individual units.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-20:head-of-the-swarm.html</guid></item><item><title>Communication Complex</title><link>https://shaos.ws/communication-complex.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One sector, semantics, concerns it-self with the meaning of symbols and words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken words, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communication is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the approaches to computer communication represents an enormous field of study with many subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central question here is cern in with a communication system. Much of the communications that occur in organizations primarly involve people, and many times the specifics illustrations of the general system pertain to communications among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Channeling Claude E. Shannon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon originally developed his model of communications while working on problems of telephone communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that analytical and highly mathematical rather than empirical, these ideas have been the foundation for many concepts grouped under the title of "Information Theory" the important aspects of these concepts are that they have been found application in analyzing not only problems in mechanical systems with links and leavers and in social systems with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communication useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled Sender, identifies the place, person, or equipment, which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels can take many forms; a simple illustration is telephone wires. Channels may also be radio waves, light waves, sound waves, pieces of paper, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned hare not only with the various forms of channels but also the ways in which organizations create them or facilitate or impede their creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 04:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-14:communication-complex.html</guid></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>https://shaos.ws/memory.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Many separate memory areas/types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our primary user base is within the distributed high-performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: Driven by &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we focus on multi-dimensional research, &lt;a href="https://shaos.ws"&gt;shaos.ws&lt;/a&gt; provide a workspace environment full of distributed asynchronous tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Provide a stable, flexible, distributed environment for kids of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux distribution is based on &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; plus the marian computer &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; environment we provide additional semi-autonomous assistance in a &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/"&gt;tiling window&lt;/a&gt; user interface, there is heavy focus on integration with &lt;a href="http://www.erlang.org/"&gt;Erlang/OTP&lt;/a&gt; and the official &lt;a href="https://github.com/zeromq/chumak"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; implementation of &lt;a href="http://zeromq.org"&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/a&gt; enabling zillions of &lt;a href="https://luerl.org"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; processes to communicate with &lt;a href="http://torch.ch"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pytorch.org/"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://openresty.org/"&gt;OpenResty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://love2d.org"&gt;LÃ–VE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://turbo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Turbo&lt;/a&gt; and all the Erlang, Python and Lua friendly multi-paradigm programming language ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make a stable workspace for distributed computing that anyone can use today, at &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we put these things together into one unified environment with native support for &lt;a href="https://luerl.org"&gt;Luerl&lt;/a&gt; an implementation of Lua written in pure Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 04:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-06-29:shaos.html</guid></item><item><title>Utility of Conflict</title><link>https://shaos.ws/utility-of-conflict.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Organizations that posses the capacity to deal adequately with conflict have been described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-06-02:utility-of-conflict.html</guid></item><item><title>Areas of undecidable decisions</title><link>https://shaos.ws/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the factors that make the life of self-regulating systems difficult at times is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem, bugs can enter systems in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in these solutions is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2016-06-23:areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</guid></item><item><title>Hexagonal Heuristics</title><link>https://shaos.ws/hexagonal-heuristics.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The honeycomb conjecture states that a regular hexagonal grid is the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
