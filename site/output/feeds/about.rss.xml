Our primary user base is within the open-source high-performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: Driven by &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we focus on experimental research facilities, &lt;a href="https://shaos.ws"&gt;shaos.ws&lt;/a&gt; provides a professional workspace environment for creative research and distributed high-performance computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible distributed workspace environment for kids of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaos HPC Linux distribution, is based on &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; network install and the lightweight &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/"&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt; tiling window manager, the BEAM virtual machine and it's only possible thanks to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chovencorp/chumak"&gt;high quality&lt;/a&gt; support for &lt;a href="http://zeromq.org"&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href="http://www.erlang.org/"&gt;Erlang/OTP&lt;/a&gt; that enables millions of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rvirding/luerl"&gt;luerl&lt;/a&gt; processes to communicate with &lt;a href="http://torch.ch"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pytorch.org/"&gt;pytorch&lt;/a&gt; and all the kids that valued eigens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make a stable workspace for high-performance computing that anyone can use today, at &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we put these things together into one unified environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2017 04:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.whs,2017-03-11:shaos-hpc-linux.html</guid></item><item><title>Areas of undecidable decisions</title><link>https://shaos.whs/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the factors that make the life of self-regulating systems difficult at times is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem, bugs can enter systems in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in these solutions is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.whs,2016-06-23:areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</guid></item><item><title>Heuristics</title><link>https://shaos.whs/heuristics.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A heuristic technique Greek: find or discover, sometimes called simple a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving learning or discovery that employs a practical methodology not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.whs,2015-05-31:heuristics.html</guid></item><item><title>Swarm intelligence</title><link>https://shaos.whs/swarm-intelligence.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of swarms or social insects. Swarm refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting agents. Technically swarms are regarded as decentralized self-organized systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence has a multidisciplinary character its study provides insights that can help humans manage complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clear definition for swarm intelligence. Emergent behaviour, self-organized behaviour and collective intelligence are the related terms. Surprisingly swarm intelligence system has the ability to act in a coordinated way without any coordinator or external controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of ‘swarm intelligence’ refers to the more general set of algorithms. SI systems consist typically of a population of simple bot agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of “intelligent” global behavior, unknown to the individual agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.whs,2015-05-25:swarm-intelligence.html</guid></item><item><title>Swarm computing</title><link>https://shaos.whs/swarm-computing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Swarm computing works by combining multiple computer systems to create a powerful, flexible computing engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swarm is similar in purpose to a “cluster”. However a swarm has very different structure and properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One computer is no computer swarm it needs at least 3 individual nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional computers that are running the “client” can request work from the computer swarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more computing power is required more computers can join or leave the swarm as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client computers can be of a variety of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
