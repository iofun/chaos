&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-06-02:utility-of-conflict.html</guid></item><item><title>SHA/OS</title><link>https://shaos.ws/shaos.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;SHA/OS is a &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the distributed open-source high-performance computing community. 
However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: Driven by &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we focus on experimental research facilities, &lt;a href="https://shaos.ws"&gt;shaos.ws&lt;/a&gt; provides a professional workspace environment for creative research and distributed high-performance computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible distributed workspace environment for kids of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SHA/OS Linux distribution, is based on &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; the UI and voice assistant is build around the lightweight &lt;a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/"&gt;i3&lt;/a&gt; tiling window manager, the BEAM Virtual Machine and it's only possible thanks to the official &lt;a href="https://github.com/zeromq/chumak"&gt;high quality&lt;/a&gt; support for &lt;a href="http://zeromq.org"&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href="http://www.erlang.org/"&gt;Erlang/OTP&lt;/a&gt; that enables millions of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rvirding/luerl"&gt;luerl&lt;/a&gt; Lua processes to communicate with &lt;a href="http://torch.ch"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pytorch.org/"&gt;pytorch&lt;/a&gt; and all the tools that valued eigens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make a stable workspace for distributed high-performance computing that anyone can use today, at &lt;a href="https://nonsense.ws"&gt;nonsense.ws&lt;/a&gt; we put these things together into one unified environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2017 04:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2017-03-11:shaos.html</guid></item><item><title>Areas of undecidable decisions</title><link>https://shaos.ws/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the factors that make the life of self-regulating systems difficult at times is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem, bugs can enter systems in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in these solutions is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2016-06-23:areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</guid></item><item><title>Heuristics</title><link>https://shaos.ws/heuristics.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A heuristic technique Greek: find or discover, sometimes called simple a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving learning or discovery that employs a practical methodology not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2015-05-31:heuristics.html</guid></item><item><title>Swarm intelligence</title><link>https://shaos.ws/swarm-intelligence.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of swarms or social insects. Swarm refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting agents. Technically swarms are regarded as decentralized self-organized systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence has a multidisciplinary character its study provides insights that can help humans manage complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clear definition for swarm intelligence. Emergent behaviour, self-organized behaviour and collective intelligence are the related terms. Surprisingly swarm intelligence system has the ability to act in a coordinated way without any coordinator or external controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of ‘swarm intelligence’ refers to the more general set of algorithms. SI systems consist typically of a population of simple bot agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of “intelligent” global behavior, unknown to the individual agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nonsense Worlds</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shaos.ws,2015-05-25:swarm-intelligence.html</guid></item><item><title>Swarm computing</title><link>https://shaos.ws/swarm-computing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Swarm computing works by combining multiple computer systems to create a powerful, flexible computing engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swarm is similar in purpose to a “cluster”. However a swarm has very different structure and properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One computer is no computer swarm it needs at least 3 individual nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional computers that are running the “client” can request work from the computer swarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more computing power is required more computers can join or leave the swarm as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client computers can be of a variety of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
