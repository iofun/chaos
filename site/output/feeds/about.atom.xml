&lt;p&gt;Since all communication is carried on in some form of language, all communications must have some process of encoding, that is, of translating information into the specific form in which it is going to be transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking an idea and converting it into words in normal conversation is an encoding process, but so is the act of a dude filling in a form using the appropriate numbers and symbols so that the proper material may be drawn from stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say if the information is in code form, there must also be a decoding process in the receiver that extracts the information the code contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Selection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to encoding, any sender carries out a process of selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is to keep the amount of information going through a system at a reasonable level to avoid overloading the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is to reduce noise by preventing other than desired messages from entering the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of selectivity occurs when information wanted by some members of an organization is kept from entering the communication system or when information important to one individual is introduced into the system by him even though it may not really be what others in the system need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selectivity also occurs at the receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purposes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of communication is intimately tied in with the purposes or needs of the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We communicate in order to influence the behavior of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Networks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements labeled "channels" need some elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus for our mental illustrations have suggested that a channel is nothing more than a simple link, such as a telephone/network wire, between two people/machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organizations, however, channels are frequently not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have noted, a channel may have parties on either end who are both senders and receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of connected links in a network so that a message starting at one end of the system has to pass through several people/machines or transmission units in getting to the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes links carry only certain types of messages, sometimes only in one direction, the conceptual model discussed identified the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a selector and encoder embodied in the sender, a system of communication links which forms a network called the channel and actually transmits the information, and steps of decoding and selecting information for use which occurs in the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement of information through a system is influenced by two principal factors, its capacity and the noise within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the capacity of the system is not exceeded, the accuracy of the transmission of information is a function of the noise, which, in turn, can be combated by redundancy, which uses up more of the channel capacity, and by coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding permits more information to be communicated but at a cost of reducing the independence of choice of the persons involved and of bringing about a greater delay in communication because of the necessity of encoding and decoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>System identification</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/system-identification.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-09T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-09T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2017-10-09:/system-identification.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data.

It can be seen as the interface between the real world of
applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of system identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data this also includes optimal design of experiments for efficiency generating information data for training such models as well as model reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamical mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system of process in either the time or frequency domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called "ballistic" because once a control signal has been send it cannot further adjusted any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast "cruise control" adjust the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Grey box model&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, statistics, and computational modeling a gray box model combines a partial theoretical structure with data to complete the model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theoretical structure may vary from information on the smoothness of results, to models that need only parameters values from data or existing literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feed-forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a term describing an element of control that passes a signal from a source in its external environment, often a command from a external operator, to a load elsewhere n its external environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its signal in a pee-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; its is in contract with a system that also has feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cybernetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of communication and control of regulatory feedback both in living and lifeless systems, organisms, organizations, machines and in combination of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its focus is how anything digital, mechanical or biological controls its behavior, process information, reacts to information and changes or can be changes to better accomplish those three primary tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Communication Systems</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/communication-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-08T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-08T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2017-10-08:/communication-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Communication involves transactions between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its inter-personal nature makes it singularly important for the study of organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of communication emerges from review if a number of aspects of organization for which communications serve as an independent variable or a constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a flow of information communication constitute an essential component of a system of coordination a person in a position to receive a great deal of information can acquire both power and status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups are characterized by a relatively easy flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property is one basis for their cohesiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By giving a person information, groups help him form his perception of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through communication people receive stimuli which evoke sets of alternative actions and induce them to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication, however, is extraordinarily bead and complex. One sector, semantics, concerns itself with the meaning of symbols and words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken word, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communications is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further elaboration on this concept, the reader is referred to Colin Cherry, On Human Communications, New York, 1961 pages; 2-16 and 217-255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communications useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled source or sender identifies the place, person or equipment which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a channel or medium protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols and devices are not perfect ways to convey messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the best we have but are subject to innumerable disturbances, many of them unpredictable, which distort confuse, or even block and therefore interfere with the accuracy of the transmission of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interference is called noise and is comprised of anything moving the the same space apart from the actual message signals wanted by the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be realistic, we have to take into account not only the noise of the channel, protocol, layers, datasets, but also of the sender and the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, as we listen to a radio, we are concerned not only with the static generated as a result of the electric storm outside, but also with the background buzz or hum which comes from the thermal disturbances in the receiver or perhaps from the broadcasting station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reducing Errors in Communications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise in a communications system is not only a nuisance but also the source of error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, during an electrical storm, a sudden flash of lightning may cause so much loud static on a communications line that it becomes impossible to hear a portion of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listener will probably ask to have the message repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple illustration includes the way on type of noise can interfere with communications and the basic way of reducing error due to noise: repeating part of the message, or as it called, redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is a repetition of any information contained in a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition includes both redundancies applied to specific disturbances, as in the illustration, and those build into language and used regularly in communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Concept of error-free transmission.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common-sense analysis suggests that since there is always some type of noise in a communications system there is always some error in the communication which we best hope to reduce to a minimum level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's analysis has shown that this is not the case, it's possible if certain conditions are met, to achieve error-free transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this necessitates the introduction of the idea of protocol, process, device or channel capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although difficult to compute, it's relatively easy to imagine that any process will have some upper or maximum limit on the amount of information it can transmit, by Shannon's analysis has shown that it is possible to achieve error-free transmissions by the use of proper coding provided the capacity of the channel is not exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially coding is transforming the message into a special form for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense it is a special language which enables is to convey more information in an individual communicative act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way the transmission rate of information can be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the original message must be translated into the code, and the process of coding takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say our objective could have just as well been defined as transmission with 2 per cent or 10 per cent error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's concepts enable us to think in terms of precisely defined transmission error with one point being zero error.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>SHA/OS</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/shaos.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-28T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-08-28T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2017-08-28:/shaos.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our primary user base is within the high-performance computing community.

&lt;p&gt;Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken words, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communication is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the approaches to computer communication represents an enormous field of study with many subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central question here is cern in with a communication system. Much of the communications that occur in organizations primarly involve people, and many times the specifics illustrations of the general system pertain to communications among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Channeling Claude E. Shannon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon originally developed his model of communications while working on problems of telephone communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that analytical and highly mathematical rather than empirical, these ideas have been the foundation for many concepts grouped under the title of "Information Theory" the important aspects of these concepts are that they have been found application in analyzing not only problems in mechanical systems with links and leavers and in social systems with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communication useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled Sender, identifies the place, person, or equipment, which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels can take many forms; a simple illustration is telephone wires. Channels may also be radio waves, light waves, sound waves, pieces of paper, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned hare not only with the various forms of channels but also the ways in which organizations create them or facilitate or impede their creation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Memory</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/memory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2017-07-04:/memory.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many separate data memory areas/types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Areas of undecidable decisions</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-23T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-06-23T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2016-06-23:/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the factors that make the life of self-regulating systems difficult at times is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem, bugs can enter systems in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in these solutions is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hexagonal Heuristics</title><link href="https://blog.nonsense.ws/hexagonal-heuristics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-19T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-19T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Team Machine</name></author><id>tag:blog.nonsense.ws,2015-05-19:/hexagonal-heuristics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The honeycomb conjecture states that a regular hexagonal grid is the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
