&lt;p&gt;We are likely to find analyses which discuss the performance of organizational elements in handling the control process but relatively little discussion of how this is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer systems are to a considerable degree influenced by basic human organizational phenomena, principal among them are perception, motivation and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic elements of the control process are few in number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering of data about performance by a sensor;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison of performance with standard by a discriminator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a difference between performance and standard is noted, two courses of action are likely to be taking by a decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undertake corrective action which will bring performance back into line with standards perhaps by selecting or developing a new process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct information about this difference to a goal setter for the establishment of new goals or the redefinition of old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;self-regulation of semi-autonomous machines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these elements exists, there is control through self-regulation of whatever entity contains them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements, however, may be allocated in a number of ways within the entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may all be performed by one person or each element may be performed by a different person or for that matter, by different departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the work of carrying the control cycle is divided further, coordination of this effort becomes more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control as we have been seen it is one type of system, we observe how control has many of the same properties as systems in general; numerous systems interblocked in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such way may be seen when there are hierarchies of systems paralleling progression of goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also systems within systems and loops within the loops. Since control is also a system, it can influence other systems and in turn be influenced by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at control as a particular type of system make us appreciate how extraordinarily complex a topic it is, and at the same time gives us an extremely valuable approach to this difficult subject.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Communication Complex</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/communication-complex.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-14T04:19:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-14:communication-complex.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One sector, semantics, concerns it-self with the meaning of symbols and words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken words, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communication is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the approaches to computer communication represents an enormous field of study with many subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central question here is cern in with a communication system. Much of the communications that occur in organizations primarly involve people, and many times the specifics illustrations of the general system pertain to communications among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Channeling Claude E. Shannon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon originally developed his model of communications while working on problems of telephone communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that analytical and highly mathematical rather than empirical, these ideas have been the foundation for many concepts grouped under the title of "Information Theory" the important aspects of these concepts are that they have been found application in analyzing not only problems in mechanical systems with links and leavers and in social systems with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communication useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled Sender, identifies the place, person, or equipment, which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels can take many forms; a simple illustration is telephone wires. Channels may also be radio waves, light waves, sound waves, pieces of paper, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned hare not only with the various forms of channels but also the ways in which organizations create them or facilitate or impede their creation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Memory</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/memory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-04:memory.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many separate memory areas/types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Variations in the control process</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/variations-in-the-control-process.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-24T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-24:variations-in-the-control-process.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The control process of an organization can be implemented in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Control Phases</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/the-control-phases.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:23:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:the-control-phases.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, n this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about some context or subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made, for example a propety is noted to be too low corrective action is required: the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker that it's yet another neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the first phases are repeated unit the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit, then another action is required and the process is shut off and killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Abstraction Models</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/abstraction-models.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:22:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:abstraction-models.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand what is happenng around us we are faced with a fundamental problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just to many facts, details and items requiring consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In approaching any situaton, the system trying to understand it, does not attempt to gather all information. Instead it selects certain facts and searchers for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of some items and ignoring of others is a process of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the abstracting fomr a real or if you will empirical situation the tings seemingly most important to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model your challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the abstracted elements, the character with the flat tire begins to connect them into a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, he weaves them into a model of the confronting situation, which we can use both to understand his plight and figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of this model would probably include, amoung other things, the flat tire, the image of the spare in the trunk, the telephone, the service station, his own forthcoming business meating, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second model would contain the telephone, the service station, and the repairman there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it concludes that it will call a cab and leave his wife to deal with the flat tire as best as she can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extraordinarily elementary models, but they serve a very practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them the main character in our illustration can see the likely consequences of various courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out these things by doing them directly by actually handling the tire and observing that we get dirty, or by calling the repairmen and waiting for him and learning that it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the model, however, we can make some reasonable predictions about what will occur and therby accept or reject the choices open to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this process of abstraction and model building we deliberately select a few items, ignore may others, and then place the items chosen in a particular relationship to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so we are intentionally ignoring facts or relationships that can influence the type of situation under study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it to select the most meaningful elements and relationships and dropout the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use abstraction skillfully know well that they neither have all the facts nor have considered all the relationships bearing on the outcome of what they are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not use the abstractions from one situation in another setting without carefully examining the fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither do we expect a model to handle all aspects of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be dealing with many abstractions and models, not with the intention of exactly mirroring the real world but with the objective of clarifying our perception of its most essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstractions and models are mechanisms for economizing both time and effort, but like any tool they must be used within their limits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Waves of the Past</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/waves-of-the-past.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:22:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:waves-of-the-past.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;An indication of the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of principles of organizations; these were didactic statements of absolute and final truths which hold in all situations like a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were' in effect, the one final answer to what an organization should be or do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones migth seem to be a regression, a loss of position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it amounts to an enourmouns step forward.

&lt;p&gt;We talk about the possible actions a person may take on recepipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about choossing amount the courses of accepting the order competly, protesting, protesting and raiisng an alternative, or leavng the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes appers as if there were a basic assumption that people consicosly bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsicusly that on other occasions he perhaps conducts consciously? We hardly know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thougth that I would act like that under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In saying this the individual indicates that he saw other opportunities and that, through some process unobservable to him he decided among them and chose on that came from elsewhere that his own conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distiontion between conscious and onconscious thought are by no means easy to determine, and for our purposes, it is not usually necessary to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerng the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence at the moment, it seems reasonable to aconduct our analysis at the level at which both machines and humans do make decisions, wihout taling into account whether the choices and decisions processes are consicious or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are concerned with control in relation to matching performance with necessary or required conditions to obtain a purpose or objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different processes which produce control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization n a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The control process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Self-regulating systems</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/self-regulating-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T14:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2016-08-02:self-regulating-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tends towards equilibrium, we noted that parts interconnected to accomplish a purpose are identified as a system. This is a property of the system, however, there are many others occurring naturally, which have this same property called homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an organization, modern production-control techniques not only plan production schedules but also build in ways to check whether these schedules are being maintained; should there be any variation there are procedures established for corrective action which are self-regulating to keep production flowing smoothly without the higher executives getting involved in the processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already noted that organizations are complexes of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now establishing that many systems are self-regulating, or to put it directly, organizations are self-regulating.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Areas of undecidable decisions</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-23T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2016-06-23:areas-of-undecidable-decisions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the factors that make the life of self-regulating systems difficult at times is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem, bugs can enter systems in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy in these solutions is the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Heuristics</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/heuristics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-31T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2015-05-31:heuristics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A heuristic technique Greek: find or discover, sometimes called simple a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving learning or discovery that employs a practical methodology not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Swarm intelligence</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/swarm-intelligence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-25T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2015-05-25:swarm-intelligence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of swarms or social insects. Swarm refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting agents. Technically swarms are regarded as decentralized self-organized systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm intelligence has a multidisciplinary character its study provides insights that can help humans manage complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clear definition for swarm intelligence. Emergent behaviour, self-organized behaviour and collective intelligence are the related terms. Surprisingly swarm intelligence system has the ability to act in a coordinated way without any coordinator or external controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of ‘swarm intelligence’ refers to the more general set of algorithms. SI systems consist typically of a population of simple bot agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of “intelligent” global behavior, unknown to the individual agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples in natural systems of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Swarm computing</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/swarm-computing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-24T16:20:00+00:00</published><author><name>Nonsense Worlds</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2015-05-24:swarm-computing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Swarm computing works by combining multiple computer systems to create a powerful, flexible computing engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One computer is no computer swarm it needs at least 3 individual nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional computers that are running the “client” can request work from the computer swarm.&lt;/p&gt;
