&lt;p&gt;The concept of error-free transmission suggests that since there is always some type of noise in a communications system there is always some error in the communication which we can at least hope to reduce to a minimum level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting factors Shannon's analysis has shown is that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible if certain conditions are met, to achieve error-free transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this necessitates the introduction of the idea of channel capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although difficult to compute, it is relatively easy to imagine that any channel will have some upper or maximum limit on the amount of information it can transmit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through mathematical analysis Shanon has shown that it is possible to achieve error-free transmissions by the use of proper coding provided if the capacity of the channel is not exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us note two things about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code is developed by the group during a process of two-way communication,  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone involved hears the proposal and agrees to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all learn the code and are able to use it with maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of codes or special languages is, as we have noted, one of the ways of improving communications, but these take time to perfect, and they are only effective when both sender and receiver understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of two-way communications or feedback is that is extremely useful in developing adequate special languages and having them learned quickly by all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, an observer may note that in a two-way communication the speaker in describing the subject looks up at the group, and even though they say nothing he pauses, apparently makes a decision, and then goes back to repeat his point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he is doing is getting a response from the general appearance of his audience that lets him know whether or not he "got through".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback, then, is a process of two-way communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two principal aspects of interest are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the response it gives the sender regarding the understanding the receivers have of his message, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the development and learning of special languages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all communication is carried on in some form of language, all communications must have some process of encoding, that is, of translating information into the specific form in which it is going to be transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking an idea and converting it into words in normal conversation is an encoding process, but so is the act of a dude filling in a form using the appropriate numbers and symbols so that the proper material may be drawn from stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say if the information is in code form, there must also be a decoding process in the receiver that extracts the information the code contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Selection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to encoding, any sender carries out a process of selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is to keep the amount of information going through a system at a reasonable level to avoid overloading the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is to reduce noise by preventing other than desired messages from entering the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of selectivity occurs when information wanted by some members of an organization is kept from entering the communication system or when information important to one individual is introduced into the system by him even though it may not really be what others in the system need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selectivity also occurs at the receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purposes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of communication is intimately tied in with the purposes or needs of the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We communicate in order to influence the behavior of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Networks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements labeled "channels" need some elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus for our mental illustrations have suggested that a channel is nothing more than a simple link, such as a telephone/network wire, between two people/machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organizations, however, channels are frequently not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have noted, a channel may have parties on either end who are both senders and receivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of connected links in a network so that a message starting at one end of the system has to pass through several people/machines or transmission units in getting to the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes links carry only certain types of messages, sometimes only in one direction, the conceptual model discussed identified the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a selector and encoder embodied in the sender, a system of communication links which forms a network called the channel and actually transmits the information, and steps of decoding and selecting information for use which occurs in the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement of information through a system is influenced by two principal factors, its capacity and the noise within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the capacity of the system is not exceeded, the accuracy of the transmission of information is a function of the noise, which, in turn, can be combated by redundancy, which uses up more of the channel capacity, and by coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding permits more information to be communicated but at a cost of reducing the independence of choice of the persons involved and of bringing about a greater delay in communication because of the necessity of encoding and decoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>System identification</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/system-identification.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-09T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-09T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-10-09:/system-identification.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data.

It can be seen as the interface between the real world of

&lt;p&gt;The field of system identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data this also includes optimal design of experiments for efficiency generating information data for training such models as well as model reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamical mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system of process in either the time or frequency domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called "ballistic" because once a control signal has been send it cannot further adjusted any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast "cruise control" adjust the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Grey box model&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, statistics, and computational modeling a gray box model combines a partial theoretical structure with data to complete the model,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theoretical structure may vary from information on the smoothness of results, to models that need only parameters values from data or existing literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feed-forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a term describing an element of control that passes a signal from a source in its external environment, often a command from a external operator, to a load elsewhere n its external environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its signal in a pee-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; its is in contract with a system that also has feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of communication emerges from review if a number of aspects of organization for which communications serve as an independent variable or a constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a flow of information communication constitute an essential component of a system of coordination a person in a position to receive a great deal of information can acquire both power and status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups are characterized by a relatively easy flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property is one basis for their cohesiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By giving a person information, groups help him form his perception of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through communication people receive stimuli which evoke sets of alternative actions and induce them to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication, however, is extraordinarily bead and complex. One sector, semantics, concerns itself with the meaning of symbols and words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken word, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communications is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further elaboration on this concept, the reader is referred to Colin Cherry, On Human Communications, New York, 1961 pages; 2-16 and 217-255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communications useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled source or sender identifies the place, person or equipment which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a channel or medium protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols and devices are not perfect ways to convey messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the best we have but are subject to innumerable disturbances, many of them unpredictable, which distort confuse, or even block and therefore interfere with the accuracy of the transmission of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interference is called noise and is comprised of anything moving the the same space apart from the actual message signals wanted by the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be realistic, we have to take into account not only the noise of the channel, protocol, layers, datasets, but also of the sender and the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, as we listen to a radio, we are concerned not only with the static generated as a result of the electric storm outside, but also with the background buzz or hum which comes from the thermal disturbances in the receiver or perhaps from the broadcasting station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reducing Errors in Communications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise in a communications system is not only a nuisance but also the source of error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, during an electrical storm, a sudden flash of lightning may cause so much loud static on a communications line that it becomes impossible to hear a portion of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listener will probably ask to have the message repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple illustration includes the way on type of noise can interfere with communications and the basic way of reducing error due to noise: repeating part of the message, or as it called, redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is a repetition of any information contained in a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition includes both redundancies applied to specific disturbances, as in the illustration, and those build into language and used regularly in communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Concept of error-free transmission.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common-sense analysis suggests that since there is always some type of noise in a communications system there is always some error in the communication which we best hope to reduce to a minimum level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's analysis has shown that this is not the case, it's possible if certain conditions are met, to achieve error-free transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this necessitates the introduction of the idea of protocol, process, device or channel capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although difficult to compute, it's relatively easy to imagine that any process will have some upper or maximum limit on the amount of information it can transmit, by Shannon's analysis has shown that it is possible to achieve error-free transmissions by the use of proper coding provided the capacity of the channel is not exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially coding is transforming the message into a special form for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense it is a special language which enables is to convey more information in an individual communicative act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way the transmission rate of information can be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the original message must be translated into the code, and the process of coding takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say our objective could have just as well been defined as transmission with 2 per cent or 10 per cent error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's concepts enable us to think in terms of precisely defined transmission error with one point being zero error.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>SHA/OS</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/shaos.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-28T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-08-28T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-08-28:/shaos.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our primary user base is within the high-performance computing community.

&lt;p&gt;Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the concurrent factors involved in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Coding &amp; Feedback</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/coding-feedback.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-15T01:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-07-15T01:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-15:/coding-feedback.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Essentially coding is transforming the message into special form for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way the transmission rate of information can be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the original message must be translated into the code, and the process of coding takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the time spent in coding is relative small and the gain in transmission rate correspondingly large, this is an efficient step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's concepts enable us to think in terms of precisely defined transmission error with one point being zero error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another step in promoting accurary in transmission is the use of feedback, that is, having some information come back from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term, feedback, is used in the area of control, we are interested in the development of error-free transmission through response and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cybernetics</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/cybernetics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-14T04:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-07-14T04:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-14:/cybernetics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Systems are so extraordinarily complex that it is difficult to deal with them in any detailed fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communications such as the written or spoken words, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third part of communication is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the approaches to computer communication represents an enormous field of study with many subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central question here is cern in with a communication system. Much of the communications that occur in organizations primarly involve people, and many times the specifics illustrations of the general system pertain to communications among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Channeling Claude E. Shannon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon originally developed his model of communications while working on problems of telephone communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that analytical and highly mathematical rather than empirical, these ideas have been the foundation for many concepts grouped under the title of "Information Theory" the important aspects of these concepts are that they have been found application in analyzing not only problems in mechanical systems with links and leavers and in social systems with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon's model is a general model of communication useful wherever there is a flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block labeled Sender, identifies the place, person, or equipment, which produces the message and sends it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channels can take many forms; a simple illustration is telephone wires. Channels may also be radio waves, light waves, sound waves, pieces of paper, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are concerned hare not only with the various forms of channels but also the ways in which organizations create them or facilitate or impede their creation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Memory</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/memory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-07-04T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-07-04:/memory.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many separate data memory areas/types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Variations in the control process</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/variations-in-the-control-process.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-24T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-24T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-24:/variations-in-the-control-process.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The control process of an organization can be implemented in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Control Phases</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/the-control-phases.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:23:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-03T16:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:/the-control-phases.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, n this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about some context or subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the first phases are repeated unit the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit, then another action is required and the process is shut off and killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Abstraction Models</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/abstraction-models.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:22:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-03T16:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:/abstraction-models.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand what is happenng around us we are faced with a fundamental problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are just to many facts, details and items requiring consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In approaching any situaton, the system trying to understand it, does not attempt to gather all information. Instead it selects certain facts and searchers for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of some items and ignoring of others is a process of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the abstracting fomr a real or if you will empirical situation the tings seemingly most important to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model your challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the abstracted elements, the character with the flat tire begins to connect them into a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, he weaves them into a model of the confronting situation, which we can use both to understand his plight and figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of this model would probably include, amoung other things, the flat tire, the image of the spare in the trunk, the telephone, the service station, his own forthcoming business meating, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second model would contain the telephone, the service station, and the repairman there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it concludes that it will call a cab and leave his wife to deal with the flat tire as best as she can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extraordinarily elementary models, but they serve a very practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them the main character in our illustration can see the likely consequences of various courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out these things by doing them directly by actually handling the tire and observing that we get dirty, or by calling the repairmen and waiting for him and learning that it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the model, however, we can make some reasonable predictions about what will occur and therby accept or reject the choices open to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this process of abstraction and model building we deliberately select a few items, ignore may others, and then place the items chosen in a particular relationship to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so we are intentionally ignoring facts or relationships that can influence the type of situation under study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it to select the most meaningful elements and relationships and dropout the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use abstraction skillfully know well that they neither have all the facts nor have considered all the relationships bearing on the outcome of what they are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not use the abstractions from one situation in another setting without carefully examining the fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither do we expect a model to handle all aspects of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be dealing with many abstractions and models, not with the intention of exactly mirroring the real world but with the objective of clarifying our perception of its most essential features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As generalizations are made about what takes place in organizations, we shall often be talking about the decision processes that organizational members engage in or the sequence of factors which lead to a particular behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about the possible actions a person may take on recepipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk about choossing amount the courses of accepting the order competly, protesting, protesting and raiisng an alternative, or leavng the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes appers as if there were a basic assumption that people consicosly bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsicusly that on other occasions he perhaps conducts consciously? We hardly know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thougth that I would act like that under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In saying this the individual indicates that he saw other opportunities and that, through some process unobservable to him he decided among them and chose on that came from elsewhere that his own conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distiontion between conscious and onconscious thought are by no means easy to determine, and for our purposes, it is not usually necessary to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerng the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence at the moment, it seems reasonable to aconduct our analysis at the level at which both machines and humans do make decisions, wihout taling into account whether the choices and decisions processes are consicious or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptial tools for analysis. As ith any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Chaos and Inconsistency</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/chaos-and-inconsistency.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-03T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-03T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2017-04-03:/chaos-and-inconsistency.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors make life of self-regulating systems difficult at times one is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Programmed links&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the process had given instruction to report immediately on completion of the task, this instruction facilitates linking the completed act with the next one. Through an information transfer, we call this a programmed link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supervisor node, of course may detect that something is wrong through another control cycle. It can then take corrective action by including or adding into this programmed link or perhaps by attacking on the more difficult problem of human apathetic attitudes and motivation his units could display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Progression of goals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations have progression of goals which result from a division of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subdivide goal becomes the task of a process contained within a specialized organizational unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nesting of goals is contained as part of the core organizational  means-ends chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the hierarchy of control loops which are connected with the progression of goals may be handle in number of ways, regardless of how the elements are allocated, the important factor is that all elements must be provided for in some way. Hence, our model supplies an extremely useful tool in analyzing complex control situations by telling us what basic functions bust occur and in what sequence, even though initially we have no idea as to where or how they are executed in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback and Goal formation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop containing information about organizational performance and conditions leads to definition of subunit goals or standards. It's important to show how a situation in one area could lead to modifications in a number of organizational units at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This even result in reformulating the basic goals of organizations. Feedback is essential to adequate goal formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to an important point which, when stated without the type of development presented, appears to be a somewhat mystical statement; namely, organizations automatically take actions to bring about their continuity or to perpetuate themselves. Of course there are times when organizations do not change goals and do go out of existence. Many, however, shift to those goals feedback defines as possible; feedback leading to goal redefinition is one of the basic ways by which organizational survival is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Time Discrepancies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem that can exist with control is that the feedback of information on performance takes so long it became impossible to correct performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect of time which should be mentioned, the time horizon of people in an organization gets progressively shorter as we come down in a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, by taking into account the perceptions of organizations members along with the time during which wortk is being performed on a prohect we can begin to define a time period within wich feedback must occur if adequate corrective action is to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Control Systems</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/control-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T16:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T16:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2016-08-02:/control-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Control is a word that has a number of meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different processes which produce control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization in a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The control process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Self-regulating systems</title><link href="https://shaos.ws/self-regulating-systems.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T14:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T14:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nonsense Web Services</name></author><id>tag:shaos.ws,2016-08-02:/self-regulating-systems.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tends towards equilibrium, we noted that parts interconnected to accomplish a purpose are identified as a system.
