    <h1 class="post-title">Control Systems</h1>
    <p>Control is a word that has a number of meanings.</p>
<p>We are concerned with control in relation to matching performance with necessary or required conditions to obtain a purpose or objective.</p>
<p>The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.</p>
<p>There are a number of different processes which produce control.</p>
<p>Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization in a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.</p>
<h2>The control process</h2>
<p>The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.</p>
<p>All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.</p>
<p>There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.</p>
<p>Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.</p>
<p>After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.</p>
<p>Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.</p>
<p>The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.</p>
<p>These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.</p>
