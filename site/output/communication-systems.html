    <h1 class="post-title">Communication Systems</h1>
    <p>Communication involves transactions between people.</p>
<p>Its inter-personal nature makes it singularly important for the study of organizations.</p>
<p>The importance of communication emerges from review if a number of aspects of organization for which communications serve as an independent variable or a constraint.</p>
<p>As a flow of information communication constitute an essential component of a system of coordination a person in a position to receive a great deal of information can acquire both power and status.</p>
<p>Groups are characterized by a relatively easy flow of information.</p>
<p>This property is one basis for their cohesiveness.</p>
<p>By giving a person information, groups help him form his perception of the world.</p>
<p>Through communication people receive stimuli which evoke sets of alternative actions and induce them to behave.</p>
<p>Communication, however, is extraordinarily bead and complex. One sector, semantics, concerns itself with the meaning of symbols and words.</p>
<p>Another sector, syntax, is concerned with the systematic properties of communication, that is, the relations between the symbols used.</p>
<p>In communications such as the written or spoken word, syntax is concerned with the relationships among letters forming words or the relationships among words in a sentence, grammar.</p>
<p>A third part of communications is concerned with pragmatics and focuses on the relationship between communication and purposeful action.</p>
<p>For further elaboration on this concept, the reader is referred to Colin Cherry, On Human Communications, New York, 1961 pages; 2-16 and 217-255.</p>
<p>Shannon's model is a general model of communications useful wherever there is a flow of information.</p>
<p>The block labeled source or sender identifies the place, person or equipment which produces the message and sends it out.</p>
<p>For the message to move between sender and receiver requires some way of its being conveyed, a channel or medium protocol.</p>
<p>Protocols and devices are not perfect ways to convey messages.</p>
<p>They are the best we have but are subject to innumerable disturbances, many of them unpredictable, which distort confuse, or even block and therefore interfere with the accuracy of the transmission of information.</p>
<p>This interference is called noise and is comprised of anything moving the the same space apart from the actual message signals wanted by the sender.</p>
<p>To be realistic, we have to take into account not only the noise of the channel, protocol, layers, datasets, but also of the sender and the receiver.</p>
<p>Hence, as we listen to a radio, we are concerned not only with the static generated as a result of the electric storm outside, but also with the background buzz or hum which comes from the thermal disturbances in the receiver or perhaps from the broadcasting station.</p>
<h4>Reducing Errors in Communications</h4>
<p>Noise in a communications system is not only a nuisance but also the source of error.</p>
<p>For example, during an electrical storm, a sudden flash of lightning may cause so much loud static on a communications line that it becomes impossible to hear a portion of the conversation.</p>
<p>The listener will probably ask to have the message repeated.</p>
<p>This simple illustration includes the way on type of noise can interfere with communications and the basic way of reducing error due to noise: repeating part of the message, or as it called, redundancy.</p>
<p>Redundancy is a repetition of any information contained in a message.</p>
<p>This definition includes both redundancies applied to specific disturbances, as in the illustration, and those build into language and used regularly in communication.</p>
<h4>The Concept of error-free transmission.</h4>
<p>Common-sense analysis suggests that since there is always some type of noise in a communications system there is always some error in the communication which we best hope to reduce to a minimum level.</p>
<p>Shannon's analysis has shown that this is not the case, it's possible if certain conditions are met, to achieve error-free transmissions.</p>
<p>To explain this necessitates the introduction of the idea of protocol, process, device or channel capacity.</p>
<p>Although difficult to compute, it's relatively easy to imagine that any process will have some upper or maximum limit on the amount of information it can transmit, by Shannon's analysis has shown that it is possible to achieve error-free transmissions by the use of proper coding provided the capacity of the channel is not exceeded.</p>
<h4>Coding</h4>
<p>Essentially coding is transforming the message into a special form for transmission.</p>
<p>In a sense it is a special language which enables is to convey more information in an individual communicative act.</p>
<p>In this way the transmission rate of information can be increased.</p>
<p>The problem is that the original message must be translated into the code, and the process of coding takes time.</p>
<p>Needless to say our objective could have just as well been defined as transmission with 2 per cent or 10 per cent error.</p>
<p>Shannon's concepts enable us to think in terms of precisely defined transmission error with one point being zero error.</p>
