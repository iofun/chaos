Multiple factors make life of self-regulating systems difficult at times one is that they have blind spots where elements working with them are incapable of adequately understanding what is going on.

No natural language is entirely complete or self-sufficient.

The same is true of systems and, in fact, has been since "language" is vital to the transmission of information in a system; but the inconsistency, problem or bug can enter in multiple ways.

To cope with these "blind spots" we have to make use of another vocabulary or system outside the one in which the doubt exists.

By going to another means of communication, such as finding a picture.

The strategy in these solutions is the same.

The incompleteness of the system or language is compensated for by resorting to something outside of the system, by using another language or another system.
