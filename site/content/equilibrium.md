Tends towards equilibrium, we noted that parts interconnected to accomplish a purpose are identified as a system. This is a property of the system, however, there are many others occurring naturally, which have this same property called homeostasis.

In an organization, modern production-control techniques not only plan production schedules but also build in ways to check whether these schedules are being maintained; should there be any variation there are procedures established for corrective action which are self-regulating to keep production flowing smoothly without the higher executives getting involved in the processes.

We have already noted that organizations are complexes of systems.

We are now establishing that many systems are self-regulating, or to put it directly, organizations are self-regulating.
