We emphasis on people and computer systems in organizations where managers and supervisors have to make decisions even through their knowledge and concepts may be wrong, inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete.

As generalizations are made about what takes place in organizations, we focus on the decision processes that organizational members engage in or the sequence of factors which lead to a particular behavior.

We mean the possible actions a person may take on receipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.

People and computers choose amount the courses of accepting the order competently, protesting, protesting and raising an alternative, or crash and leaving the organization.

It sometimes appears as if there were a basic assumption that people consciously bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.

Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsciously that on other occasions he perhaps conducts consciously? We hardly know...

We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thought that I would act like that under those circumstances.

In saying this the individual indicates that he saw other opportunities and that, through some process unobservable to him he decided among them and chose on that came from elsewhere that his own conscious thought.

The distinction between conscious and unconscious thought are by no means easy to determine, and for our purposes, it is not usually necessary to make them.

Considering the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence at the moment, it seems reasonable to conduct our analysis at the level at which both machines and humans do make decisions, without taking into account whether the choices and decisions processes are conscious or not.

Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptual tools for analysis. As with any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.
