In the context of information theory.

The concept of error-free transmission suggests that since there is always some type of noise in a communications system there is always some error in the communication which we can at least hope to reduce to a minimum level.

One of the interesting factors Shannon's analysis has shown is that this is not the case.

It is possible if certain conditions are met, to achieve error-free transmissions.

To explain this necessitates the introduction of the idea of channel capacity.

Although difficult to compute, it is relatively easy to imagine that any channel will have some upper or maximum limit on the amount of information it can transmit.

Through mathematical analysis Shanon has shown that it is possible to achieve error-free transmissions by the use of proper coding provided if the capacity of the channel is not exceeded.

Let us note two things about this:

1. the code is developed by the group during a process of two-way communication,  
2. everyone involved hears the proposal and agrees to it.

They all learn the code and are able to use it with maximum effectiveness.

Development of codes or special languages is, as we have noted, one of the ways of improving communications, but these take time to perfect, and they are only effective when both sender and receiver understand them.

One aspect of two-way communications or feedback is that is extremely useful in developing adequate special languages and having them learned quickly by all parties involved.

Second, an observer may note that in a two-way communication the speaker in describing the subject looks up at the group, and even though they say nothing he pauses, apparently makes a decision, and then goes back to repeat his point.

What he is doing is getting a response from the general appearance of his audience that lets him know whether or not he "got through".

Feedback, then, is a process of two-way communication.

Two principal aspects of interest are:

1. the response it gives the sender regarding the understanding the receivers have of his message, and
2. the development and learning of special languages.
