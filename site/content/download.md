Summary: SHA/OS is a distributed workstation with custom configurations and additional software focus on high-performance and scientific computation.

## Hosted
Hosted systems have been reported to run on Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS Linux.

You can use LuaRocks to install the SHA/OS cube-cli on Linux.

``luarocks install cube-cli``

If the installation fails make sure that you have [singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov) installed.


For help using cube-cli, including a list of commands, run:

  `$ cube-cli --help`

## Native
If you can use BitTorrent, please do so and leave the client open for a while so you can seed the files for other users. Otherwise, use the [direct download](https://shaos.ws/images/shaos-8.17-amd64.iso).
