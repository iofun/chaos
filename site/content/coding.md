Essentially coding is transforming the message into special form for transmission.

In a sense it is a special language which enables us to convey more information in an individual communication act.

In this way the transmission rate of information can be increased.

The problem is that the original message must be translated into the code, and the process of coding takes time.

If the time spent in coding is relative small and the gain in transmission rate correspondingly large, this is an efficient step.

Shannon's concepts enable us to think in terms of precisely defined transmission error with one point being zero error.

### Feedback

Another step in promoting accurary in transmission is the use of feedback, that is, having some information come back from the receiver.

The term, feedback, is used in the area of control, we are interested in the development of error-free transmission through response and learning.
