Systems are so extraordinarily complex that it is difficult to deal with them in any detailed fashion.

We are likely to find analyses which discuss the performance of organizational elements in handling the control process but relatively little discussion of how this is accomplished.

Doibles at time goes out knoledge of these details will grow. We mention the inadequancy of out knowledge at this time fot two reasons:

1 so the reader will have an appreciation of the complexity of the problem and

2 to point out that even if we do not know many details, we are still able to use cybernetics systems to cope with manu important problems.

Computer systems are to a considerable degree influenced by basic organizational phenomena, principal among them are perception, motivation and communication.

The basic elements of the control process were few in number:

1 gathering of data about performance by a sensor;

2 comparison of performance with standard by a discriminator

3 when a difference between performance and standard is noted, two courses of action are likely to be taking by a decision maker:

A) to undertake corrective action which will bring performance back into line with standards perhaps by selecting or developing a new program

B) to direct information about this difference to a goal setter for the establishment of new goals or the redefinition of old ones.

When these elements exists, there is control through self-regulation of whatever entity contains them.

The elements, however, may be allocated in a number of ways within the entity.

They may all be performed by one person or each element may be performed by a different person or for that matter, by different departments.

As the work of carrying the control cycle is divided further, coordination of this effort becomes more difficult.

Control as we have been seen it is one type of system, hence we find control has many of the same properties as systems in general; numerous systems interblocked in many ways.

One such way may be seen when there are hierarchies of systems paralleling progression of goals and events.

There are also systems within systems and loops within the loops. Since control is also a system, it can influence other systems and in turn be influenced by them.

Looking at control as a particular type of system make us appreciate how extraordinarily complex a topic it is, and at the same time gives us an extremely valuable approach to this difficult subject.
