## an indication of the future

Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of principles of organizations; these were didactic statements of absolute and final truths which hold in all situations like a silver bullet.

They were' in effect, the one final answer to what an organization should be or do.

Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.

On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones migth seem to be a regression, a loss of position.

Actually, it amounts to an enourmouns step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the multitud and complexity of the factors involved in organizations.
