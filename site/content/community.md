SHA/OS is a distributed operating system full of high-availability tools that runs on a wide variety of platforms.

The system run hosted as a user space application on any existing linux distribution and it's also available pre-installed on top of a custom [Debian](https://debian.org) live image.

Each node presents an identical environment to your working space, irrespective of the underlying host our focus allow you to spawn clean egalitarian homogeneous grids across multiple clusters of heterogeneous peers.

A communications protocol called [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org) version 3.1 is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources with official support for processes in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), [Lua](https://lua.org) and community support for multiple other languages that all communicate like you and me by passing messages around.
