SHA/OS is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. 

Our primary user base is within the distributed high-performance computing community. However, our power users come from a wide variety of studios and industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on multi-dimensional research, [shaos.ws](https://shaos.ws) provide a workspace environment full of distributed high-availability tools.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, flexible, distributed environment for kids of all ages.

The Linux distribution is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) plus all computer [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) environment we provide additional semi-autonomous assistance in a [tiling window](https://i3wm.org/docs/) user interface, there is heavy focus on [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) and the official [native](https://github.com/zeromq/chumak) implementation of [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). You can talk to any other ZeroMQ stack on your network.

Other native [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org/) implementations are libzmq (C++), NetMQ (C#), JeroMQ (Java), libzmtp (C).

We make a stable workspace for distributed computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) these things work together into one unified environment with native support for [Luerl](https://luerl.org) an implementation of Lua written in Erlang that integrate both [#LuaLang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lualang?src=hash) and the BEAM ecosystems.

This integration enables zillions of [Lua](https://luerl.org) processes inside the BEAM to communicate with [Torch](http://torch.ch), [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/), [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), [Turbo](https://turbo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and all the Erlang, Python and Lua programming language communities and ecosystems.
