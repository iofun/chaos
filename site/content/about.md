SHA/OS is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. 

Our primary user base is within the distributed high-performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries and use cases.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on multi-dimensional computer science research, [shaos.ws](https://shaos.ws) provide a linux workspace environment full of distributed asynchronous tools.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, scalable, extensible, distributed environment for kids of all ages.

The Linux distribution is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) plus the [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) environment we provide chat and voice assistance in a [tiling window](https://i3wm.org/docs/) user interface, there is heavy focus on integration with the BEAM [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) VM and the official [native](https://github.com/zeromq/chumak) implementation of [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) that enable zillions of [Lua](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) processes to communicate with [torch](http://torch.ch), [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/), [openresty](http://openresty.org/), [love2d](https://love2d.org), [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), [turbo](https://turbo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and all our Erlang, Python and Lua friends, we bring you a small box full of tools for the cloud forest jungle.

We make a stable workspace for distributed high-performance computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we put these things together into one open-source unified environment.
