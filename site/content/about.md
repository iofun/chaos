Shaos HPC Linux is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the high-performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on experimental research facilities, [shaos.ws](https://shaos.ws) provides a world class environment for creative research and distributed polyglot high-performance computing.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible distributed workspace environment for kids of all ages.

Shaos HPC Linux distribution, is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) stable and the lightweight [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/) tiling window manager, the beam virtual machine and it's only possible thanks to the [high quality](https://github.com/chovencorp/chumak) support for [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) within [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) that enables millions of [luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) processes to communicate with [torch](http://torch.ch) and [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/).

For information about how to get help or get involved see the [Community Wiki](https://github.com/nonsensews/guide/wiki).

We make a stable workspace for high-performance computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we put these things together into one unified environment.
