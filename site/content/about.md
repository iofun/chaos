SHA/OS is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the distributed open-source high-performance computing community. 
However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on experimental research facilities, [shaos.ws](https://shaos.ws) provide a professional workspace environment for creative research and distributed high-performance computing.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible distributed workspace environment for kids of all ages.

The SHA/OS Linux distribution, is based up on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) the UI and voice assistant is build around the lightweight [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/) tiling window manager, the BEAM Virtual Machine and it's only possible thanks to the official [high quality](https://github.com/zeromq/chumak) support for [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) within [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) that enables millions of [luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) Lua processes to communicate with [torch](http://torch.ch), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) and all the tools that valued eigens.

For information about how to get help or get involved see the [Community Wiki](https://github.com/nonsensews/guide/wiki).

We make a stable workspace for distributed high-performance computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we put these things together into one unified environment.
