Shaos HPC Linux is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the high-performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on the needs of experimental research facilities, shaos provides a world class environment for creative research and high-performance computing.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible distributed workspace environment for creativity and scientific research.

Shaos HPC Linux distribution, is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) stable and the lightweight [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/) window manager, the beam virtual machine and it's possible thanks to the high quality support for zeromq with Erlang/OTP that enables millions of luerl processes to communicate with torch and/or pytorch.

For information about how to get help or get involved see the [Community Guide](https://github.com/nonsensews/guide) wiki page.

We make a stable platform for high-performance distributed computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we put these two things together into one unified environment.
