Our primary user base is within the high-performance computing community. However, our power users come from a wide variety of industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) we focus on multi-dimensional research, [shaos.ws](https://shaos.ws) provide a workspace environment full of distributed high-availability tools.

**Our Goal**: Provide a distributed open-source toolset and environment for scientists of all ages.

The environment is build on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) plus all computer [nonsense](https://nonsense.ws) we provide additional semi-autonomous assistance in a [tiling window](https://i3wm.org/docs/) user interface with heavy focus on [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/) and the official [native](https://github.com/zeromq/chumak) implementation of [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). 


Other native [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org/) implementations are libzmq (C++), NetMQ (C#), JeroMQ (Java), libzmtp (C). You can easily talk to any other ZeroMQ stack on your network. 

This integration enables zillions of [Lua](https://luerl.org) processes inside the BEAM to communicate with [Torch](http://torch.ch), [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/), [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), [Turbo](https://turbo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov), etc.. just to name some [examples](https://github.com/nonsensews/cube-cli/tree/master/index) and focus around mutualism and balance inside multilingual systems of [Erlang](http://erlang.org), [Python](http://python.org) and [Lua](https://lua.org) things.

We make a stable workspace for distributed computing that anyone can use today, at [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) these things work together into one unified environment with native support for [Luerl](https://luerl.org) an implementation of Lua written in Erlang that integrate both [#LuaLang](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lualang?src=hash) and the BEAM ecosystems.
