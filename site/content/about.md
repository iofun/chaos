Shaos HPC Linux is a [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the high performance computing community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries.

**Our Mission**: Driven by [nonsense.ws](https://nonsense.ws) and focus on the needs of experimental research facilities, shaos provide a world class environment for high performance computing.

**Our Goal**: Provide a stable, scalable, and extensible environment for creative experimentation and scientific computing.

Shaos HPC Linux distribution, is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) stable and built around the lightweight [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/) window manager.

For information about how to get help or get involved see the [Community Guide](https://github.com/nonsensews/guide) github wiki.

We make a stable platform for high performance computing that anyone can use. Today, we focus on putting these two things together into one unified environment.
