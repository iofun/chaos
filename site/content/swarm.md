Swarm computing works by combining multiple computer systems to create a powerful, flexible computing engine.

A swarm is similar in purpose to a “cluster”. However a swarm has very different structure and properties:

+ One computer is no computer swarm it needs at least 3 individual nodes.

+ Additional computers that are running the “client” can request work from the computer swarm.

+ If more computing power is required more computers can join or leave the swarm as necessary.

+ Client computers can be of a variety of specifications.
