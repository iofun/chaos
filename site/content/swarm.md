Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.

The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of social animals and swarms of insects. Swarm in this context refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting actors. Technically swarms are regarded as decentralized self-organized systems.

The application of ‘swarm intelligence’ refers to a more general set of algorithms. This type of systems consist typically of a population of simple bots or units interacting locally with one another and with their environment.

The inspiration comes from nature, biological systems and especially physics, including general relativity and quantum mechanics.

The actors follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual processes should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such units lead to the emergence of “intelligent” global behavior, unknown to the individual actors.

There is no clear definition for swarm intelligence. Emergent behaviour, self-organized behaviour and collective intelligence are the related terms. Surprisingly swarm intelligence systems have the ability to act in a coordinated way without any coordinator or external controller.


Swarm intelligence has a multidisciplinary character its study provides insights that can help humans manage complex systems.
