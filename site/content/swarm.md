The collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial.

Swarm in this context refers to any loosely structured collection of interacting units.

The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence that aims to simulate the behavior of social animals.

The application of '*swarm intelligence*' refers to a more general set of algorithms.

This type of systems consist typically of a population of simple bots or units interacting locally with one another and with their environment.

The inspiration comes from nature, biological systems and especially physics, including general relativity and quantum mechanics.

The system follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how working units should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between them lead to the emergence of “*intelligent*” global behavior, unknown to the individual units.
