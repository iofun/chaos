Out emphasis is on people in organizations where managers have to make decisions even through their knowledge and concepts may be wrong or inadequate.

As generalizations are made about what takes place in organizations, we shall often be talking about the decision processes that organozational members engage in or the sequence of factors which lead to a particular behavior.

We talk about the possible actions a person may take on recepipt of an order from his superior, which he thinks is improper and unwarranted.

We talk about choossing amount the courses of accepting the order competly, protesting, protesting and raiisng an alternative, or leavng the organization.

It sometimes appers as if there were a basic assumption that people consicosly bring our all these possibilities and rationally weigh the pros and cons of each.

Does the individual at times carry on the same process unconsicusly that on other occasions he perhapsconduncts consciously? We hardly know...

We are faced with the fact that people sometimes do things and later say, I never thougth that I would act like that under those circumstances.
