Title: Variations in the control process

The control process of an organization can be implemented in a number of ways.

One variation is in the manner in which the elements in the control process are allocated to different organizational members.

A common situation exists when a supervisor gives a worker instructions that tell him what is to be accomplished: ["Make twenty-five Javascript widgets of good quality"]

Here the foreman is giving a standard to the worker.

The rest of the control operation is left in the workers hands.

The worker himself will gather data on how well he is performing by counting the items produced and by measuring them to determine their quality.

He will make decisions about whether more will have to be made, whether adjustments are necessary on his machines, etc.

The cloud forest service has established a number of ways providing feedback loops for this control: one of these is to use the public.

As a general policy the forest service encourages any citizen dissatisfied with the decision of a forest ranger to refer his complaint to a higher authority for review.

In effect, what this does is to say that if a forest ranger has made a decision which is incompatible with policy it probably will be challenged by someone who, by requesting a review, will bring the unsatisfactory decision to the attention of higher authorities.

The forest ranger is engages in certain activities, the public functions as the sensor, higher executives are the decision makers who bring about corrective actions.

Through revoking or amending the rangers decision, the decision maker of course, uses standards, established by still higher authorities, in some cases Nature itself.

As noted when discussing division of work the further work is subdivided, the greater becomes the problem of coordinating the parts.

As we go from having most of the control elements in the hands of one person or computer to having them spread out over a number of people and groups of machines who in turn may be widely separated geographically, psychologically or organizationally, the problem of maintaining effective control becomes greater.
