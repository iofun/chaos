Control is a word that has a number of meanings.

We are concerned with control in relation to matching performance with necessary or required conditions to obtain a purpose or objective.

The essence here is on reactivity and integration of effort, required accomplishment of an end.

There are a number of different processes which produce control.

Control is concerned not only with events directly related to the accomplishment of major purposes but also with maintaining the organization in a condition in which it can function adequately to achieve these major purposes.

##The control process
The study of control has received a great deal of attention by people in number of different fields. This has come about with the realization that control is basic to an extraordinarily wide array of things.

All though the mechanism of control are different in each of these situations, analysis shows the process is the same.

Therefore, people have begun to study control as a universal process, a topic which can be studied in its own right.

There is a data-gathering phase in which a device, in this case generally called a sensor, gathers information about a subject.

Then comes a comparing or examination phase when the desired output is compared with the standard by a unit called a discriminator.

After this comparison is made and, for example a property is noted to be too low corrective action is required; the process is turned on by a unit we will call a decision maker.

Once the process is running, the fist phases are repeated until the discriminator determines that the property has reached or exceeded the upper limit; then another action is required, and the process is shut off.

The basic steps in the control process identified thus far are: gathering data on performance, comparison of data with a standard, and taking corrective action if performance does not match the standard properly.

These phases are carried out by a sensor, discriminator, and decision maker.
