### An indication of the future

Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of mirrors for princes and principles of organizations; these were didactic statements which hold on certain situations and aspects of control and behavior, but in a broader sense, the term is also used to cover histories or work aimed at creating patterns for imitation or avoidance.


Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.

On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.

Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the multitude and complexity of the factors involved in organizations.
