The honeycomb conjecture states that a regular hexagonal grid or honeycomb is the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter.

The first record of the conjecture dates back to 36BC, from Marcus Terentius Varro.

A heuristic technique Greek: find or discover, sometimes called simple a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving learning or discovery that employs a practical methodology not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.
