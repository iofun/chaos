Organizations that posses the capacity to deal adequately with conflict have been described as follows:

1. They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.

2. The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).

3. There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.

Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests. - Rensin Likert, New Patterns of Management, New York, McGraw-Hill, 1961, p.117.

The essence here is that out of conflict will come a new synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in the conflict.

Likert mentions a need for skill in interpersonal relations. Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted. The first informal development, however, may be contrary to previously established procedures and in a sense a violation or a subversion of them; or the informal procedures may be an extension of a function for internal political purposes. - For discussion of these see Melville Dalton, Fusions of Feeling and Theory in Administration, New York, John Wiley, 1959, Chapter 10.

Conflict, resting in part on different perspectives of what "ought" to be, is one of the avenues for opening new directions for the organization or one of the ways of moving in new directions. This is not only useful but also vital for organizational survival. The question, therefore, as we view conflict is not, "How to eliminate it?" but, "Is it conflict of such a type and within circumstances where it will contribute to rather than detract from organizational interest?"

Whether a conflict is good or bad for an organization, whether a conflict can be made useful for an organization, depends not so much on manipulating the conflict itself as on the underlying conditions of the overall organization. In this sense, conflict can be seen as;

1. a symptom of more basic problems which requires attention, or

2. an intervening variable in the overall organization to be considered, used, and maintained within certain useful boundaries.
