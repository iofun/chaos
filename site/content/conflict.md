Organizations that posses the capacity to deal adequately with conflict have been described as follows:

1. They posses the machinery to deal constructively with conflict. They have an structure which facilitates constructive interaction between individuals and work groups.

2. The personnel of the organization is skilled in the process of effective interaction and mutual influence (skills in group ledership and membership roles in group building and maintenance functions).

3. There is a high confidence and trust in one another among members of the organization, loyalty to the work group and to the organization, and high motivation to achieve the organization's objectives.

Confidence, loyalty, and cooperative motivation produce earnest, sincere, and determined efforts to find solutions to conflict. There is greater motivation to find constructive solution that to maintain an irreconcilable conflict. The solutions reached are often highly creative and represent a far better solution than any initially proposed by the conflicting interests. - Rensin Likert, New Patterns of Management, New York, McGraw-Hill, 1961, p.117.

The essence here is that out of conflict will come a nbew synthesis superior to what existed before and perhaps superior to any individual point of view existent in the conflict.

Likert mentions a need for skill in interpersonal relations. Organizational adaptation frequently proceeds through a new arrangement developing informally, which, after proving its worth and becoming accepted, is formally adopted.
