Introduction of the idea of code and the process of coding a message makes it apparent that the sender really includes several components.

Since all communication is carried on in some form of language, all communications must have some process of encoding, that is, of translating information into the specific form in which it is going to be transmitted.

Taking an idea and converting it into words in normal conversation is an encoding process, but so is the act of a dude filling in a form using the appropriate numbers and symbols so that the proper material may be drawn from stock.

Needless to say if the information is in code form, there must also be a decoding process in the receiver that extracts the information the code contains.

#### Selection

In addition to encoding, any sender carries out a process of selection.

There are numerous reasons for this.

One of these is to keep the amount of information going through a system at a reasonable level to avoid overloading the system.

Another is to reduce noise by preventing other than desired messages from entering the system.

Another type of selectivity occurs when information wanted by some members of an organization is kept from entering the communication system or when information important to one individual is introduced into the system by him even though it may not really be what others in the system need.

Selectivity also occurs at the receiving end.

#### Purposes

Much of communication is intimately tied in with the purposes or needs of the parties involved.

We communicate in order to influence the behavior of others.

#### Networks

The elements labeled "channels" need some elaboration.

Thus for our mental illustrations have suggested that a channel is nothing more than a simple link, such as a telephone/network wire, between two people/machines.

In organizations, however, channels are frequently not that simple.

As we have noted, a channel may have parties on either end who are both senders and receivers.

There may be a number of connected links in a network so that a message starting at one end of the system has to pass through several people/machines or transmission units in getting to the other end.

Sometimes links carry only certain types of messages, sometimes only in one direction, the conceptual model discussed identified the following elements:

a selector and encoder embodied in the sender, a system of communication links which forms a network called the channel and actually transmits the information, and steps of decoding and selecting information for use which occurs in the receiver.

The movement of information through a system is influenced by two principal factors, its capacity and the noise within it.

If the capacity of the system is not exceeded, the accuracy of the transmission of information is a function of the noise, which, in turn, can be combated by redundancy, which uses up more of the channel capacity, and by coding.

Coding permits more information to be communicated but at a cost of reducing the independence of choice of the persons involved and of bringing about a greater delay in communication because of the necessity of encoding and decoding.
