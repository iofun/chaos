The art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. It can be seen as the interface between the real world of
applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions.

The field of system identification uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data this also includes optimal design of experiments for efficiency generating information data for training such models as well as model reduction

A dynamical mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system of process in either the time or frequency domain

Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called "ballistic" because once a control signal has been send it cannot further adjusted any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal.

In contrast "cruise control" adjust the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.

#### Grey box model

In mathematics, statistics, and computational modeling a gray box model combines a partial theoretical structure with data to complete the model,

The theoretical structure may vary from information on the smoothness of results, to models that need only parameters values from data or existing literature.

#### Feed-forward
a term describing an element of control that passes a signal from a source in its external environment, often a command from a external operator, to a load elsewhere n its external environment.

A system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its signal in a pee-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; its is in contract with a system that also has feedback.

#### Feedback
Which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.

#### Cybernetics

The study of communication and control of regulatory feedback both in living and lifeless systems, organisms, organizations, machines and in combination of those.

Its focus is how anything digital, mechanical or biological controls its behavior, process information, reacts to information and changes or can be changes to better accomplish those three primary tasks.
