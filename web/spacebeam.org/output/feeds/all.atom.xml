It is a building? A collection of machinery? A legal document containing a statement of incorporation? It is hardly likely to be any of these by itself. Rather, to describe an organization requires the consideration of a number of properties it possesses, thus gradually making clear, or at least clearer, that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purposes of the organization, whether it is formal or informal, are accomplished by a collection of members whose efforts or behavior are so directed that they become coordinated and integrated in order to attain sub-goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perception and behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at some point or another have had the experience of watching another person do something or behave in a certain way, saying to ourselves, "She/he acts as if she/he thought, ... " and then filling in some supposition about the way the other person looked at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple as the statement "She acts as if she thought ... " may be, it illustrates two important points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what the person thinks she sees may not actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is that people act on the basis of what they see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In understanding behavior, we must recognize that facts people do not perceive as meaningful usually will not influence their behavior, whereas the things they believe to be real, even though factually incorrect or nonexistent, will influence it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are intended to bring about integrated behavior. Similar, or at least compatible, perceptions on the part of organizational members are therefore a matter of prime consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Process of abstraction</title><link href="/2019/10/19/process-of-abstraction/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-19T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Spacebeam Community</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-19:/2019/10/19/process-of-abstraction/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand what is happening around us we are faced with a fundamental problem.

In approaching any situation, the system trying to understand it, does not attempt to gather all information. Instead it selects certain facts and searchers for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of some items and ignoring of others is a process of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the abstracting form a real or if you will empirical situation the things seemingly most important to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this process of abstraction and model building we deliberately select a few items, ignore may others, and then place the items chosen in a particular relationship to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so we are intentionally ignoring facts or relationships that can influence the type of situation under study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it to select the most meaningful elements and relationships and dropout the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use abstraction skillfully know well that they neither have all the facts nor have considered all the relationships bearing on the outcome of what they are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not use the abstractions from one situation in another setting without carefully examining the fit. Neither do we expect a model to handle all aspects of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be dealing with many abstractions and models, not with the intention of exactly mirroring the real world but with the objective of clarifying our perception of its most essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstractions and models are mechanisms for economizing both time and effort, but like any tool they must be used within their limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model your goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the abstracted elements, a character with the flat tire begins to connect them into a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, he weaves them into a model of the confronting situation, which we can use both to understand his plight and figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of this model would probably include, among other things, the flat tire, the image of the spare in the trunk, the telephone, the service station, a forthcoming business meting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second model would contain the telephone, the service station, and the repairman there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it concludes that it will call a cab and leave his wife to deal with the flat tire as best as she can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extraordinarily elementary models, but they serve a very practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them the main character in our illustration can see the likely consequences of various courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out these things by doing them directly by actually handling the tire and observing that we get dirty, or by calling the repairmen and waiting for him and learning that it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of big data; big models are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any given size of data, the bigger the model, the better it generalizes, provided you regularize well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is obviously true if your model is an ensemble of smaller models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding extra models to the ensemble always helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a good idea to try to make the data look small by using a big model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the model, however, we can make some reasonable predictions about what will occur and therby accept or reject the choices open to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptual tools for analysis. As with any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cognitive framework</title><link href="/2019/10/13/cognitive-framework/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-13T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Spacebeam Community</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-13:/2019/10/13/cognitive-framework/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development proposes that humans cannot be given information, in which they immediately understand and use.

Instead, learners must construct their own knowledge. They build their knowledge through experience. Experiences enable them to create mental models of the world. These models are changed, enlarged, and made more sophisticated through two complimentary processes: assimilation and accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition of intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piaget's definition of intelligence itself does not consist of an isolated cognitive process. It is not, one form of structure among others; it is the form of equilibrium towards which all the structures or cognitive processes tend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is only a generic term to indicate the equilibrium of cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believed, human beings inherit a tendency to organize their intellectual processes and to develop particular adaptations to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual adaptation is also an exchange between a person and its environment and involves the same two processes of assimilation and accommodation found in biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assimilation involves the person dealing with the environment in terms of its structures, while accommodation involves the transformation of its structures in response to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular ways in which an organism adapts and organize its processes depend also on its environment and learning history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cognitive constructivism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive constructivism is based on two different senses of construction. First, on the idea that people learn by actively constructing new knowledge, not by having information poured into their heads. Moreover, constructivism asserts that people learn with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful artifacts (e.g. computer programs, animations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;View of learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because knowledge is actively constructed, learning is presented as a process of active discovery. The role of the instructor is not to drill knowledge into students through consistent repetition, or to goad them into learning through carefully employed rewards and punishments. Rather, the role of the teacher is to facilitate discovery by providing the necessary resources and by guiding learners as they attempt to assimilate new knowledge to old and to modify the old to accommodate the new.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Undermind podcast 33</title><link href="/2019/10/06/the-undermind-podcast-33/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-06T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Spacebeam Community</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-06:/2019/10/06/the-undermind-podcast-33/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
