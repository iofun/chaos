It is not, properly speaking, one form of structuring among others; it is     the form of equilibrium towards which all the structures arising out of perception, habit and elementary sensor-motor mechanisms tend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is thus only a generic term to indicate the superior forms of organization or equilibrium of cogntive processes`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean Piaget show us that every life form follow the two tendencies organization and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organization refers to the tendency for all species to systematize or organize their processes into coherent systems which may be either physical or phychological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Piaget, intellectual adaptation is also an interaction, or an exchange, between a person an its environment and involves the same two processes, assimilation and accomoation as are found in biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assimilation involves the person's dealing with the environment in terms of its structures, while accomodation involves the transformation of its structures in response to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular ways in which an organism adapts and organizes its processes depend also on its environment and learning history. In Piaget's view human beings inherit a tendecy to organize their intellectual processes and to develop particular adaptations to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Undermind podcast 33</title><link href="/2019/10/06/the-undermind-podcast-33/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-06T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-06T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Spacebeam Community</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-06:/2019/10/06/the-undermind-podcast-33/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to hear again from Johan de Jong the author of BananaBrain one of the top competitive protoss bots, he talked about his work around Dark Templar and Reaver/Shuttle micro as well as goin into details about his development process and path-finding fixed issues, BananaBrain was 5th in CoG 2019, Johan comment about learning strategies used in competitions raising the question about the amount of rounds available since this affects directly the learning capabilities and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Weber the author of CUNYBot is a resercher at the College of Staten Island, he is interested in macroeconomics and works with a couple of students that every few semesters make modifications, and improvements on the bot. It was interesting to hear about his experience and adventures enabling the Python interpreter inside CUNYbot and through the land mine of building the bot for competition and also enable a modern machine learning stack as well as his comments on genetic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
