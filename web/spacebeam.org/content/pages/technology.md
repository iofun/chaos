Spacebeam present `Char` a custom Debian (x86_64) distribution for simple computational clusters, grid endpoints and visualization on tiled-displays; installation and support is also available from community members.

Char is a cluster system that run hosted as an user-space application on any existing Linux distribution and it's also available pre-installed on top of a custom [Debian](https://debian.org) live image, made for students starting out.

Each node presents an identical environment to your working space, irrespective of the underlying host our focus it allow you to spawn clean computational grids across multiple clusters of peers.

A communications protocol called [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org) version 3.1 is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources with official support for independent processes in [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Lua](https://lua.org) and community support for other languages via standard ZeroMQ libraries.

## Our work process
We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on Spacebeam, which means that every proposed change is tracked as an issue.

Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.

An ideal description for an issue goes:

- Problem: (describe the problem here)
- Solution: (describe your solution here)

Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.

Come with clear problems and pausible solutions.
