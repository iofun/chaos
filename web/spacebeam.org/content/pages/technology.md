Spacebeam present a custom Debian (x86_64) distribution for simple computational clusters, grid endpoints and visualization on tiled-displays; installation and support is also available from community members.

Each node presents an identical environment to your working space, a communications protocol called [ZMTP](http://zmtp.org) version 3.1 is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources with official support for [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Lua](https://lua.org), and community support available as well for other languages via standard ZeroMQ libraries.

## Our work process
We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on Spacebeam, which means that every proposed change is tracked as an issue.

Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.

An ideal description for an issue goes:

- Problem: (describe the problem here)
- Solution: (describe your solution here)

Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.

Come with clear problems and pausible solutions.

## Code and documentation

The source code lives at the [Spacebeam](https://github.com/spacebeam) GitHub organization.

The [guide](https://github.com/spacebeam/guide/wiki) explains our environment and the community [website](https://spacebeam.org) links to our work process, read the rules and join the adventure!
