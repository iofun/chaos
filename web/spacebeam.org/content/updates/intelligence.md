description: Organization refers to the tendency of all species to systematize or organize their processes into coherent systems which may be either physical or psychological. Adaptation is the balance between the independent processes of assimilation and accomodation.

We believe Jean Piaget's definition of intelligence: intelligence itself does not consist of an isolated and sharply differentiated class of cognitive process. It is not, properly speaking, one form of structuring among others; it is     the form of equilibrium towards which all the structures arising out of perception, habit and elementary sensor-motor mechanisms tend.

Intelligence is thus only a generic term to indicate the superior forms of organization or equilibrium of cogntive processes`

Jean Piaget show us that every life form follow the two tendencies organization and adaptation.

Organization refers to the tendency for all species to systematize or organize their processes into coherent systems which may be either physical or phychological.

For Piaget, intellectual adaptation is also an interaction, or an exchange, between a person an its environment and involves the same two processes, assimilation and accomoation as are found in biology.

Assimilation involves the person's dealing with the environment in terms of its structures, while accomodation involves the transformation of its structures in response to the environment.

The particular ways in which an organism adapts and organizes its processes depend also on its environment and learning history. In Piaget's view human beings inherit a tendecy to organize their intellectual processes and to develop particular adaptations to their environment.
