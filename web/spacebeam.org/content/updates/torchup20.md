title: What about the Torch Up tournament?
date: 2020-03-13
description: Did the tournament happen? Did it complete? Were the results perhaps announced to raised beers and general carousing so that nobody remembers them any more?

It appears that the humans controled by our AI crashed. Our machine supervisors have schedule again the games from the 16 to Mar 20, if our humans crash again we will continue re scheduling the tournament games until we have at least a first completed round, replays and results.

The results of the tournamet will be updated in the `updates` section of the tournament website as the rules state, we have been battling against our own technical debth, implementation and irrelevant internal details but we are commited to release and announce the tournament results as soon as they become available and make this event an annual competition with the particularity that we can meet in beutiful brussels, once in a year at FOSDEM, a self-organized conference for libre and open-source software like BWAPI and all of us around it.

About the announced new maps they are relevant only for next year competition and up, a hopefully more stable event where we are learning from the iterations and the progress with our current mistakes, crashes, burns and bugs, the maps are a mix of old and new competitive maps for 2v2 and 1v1 with lots of surprises, we have no doubt they will be a challenge for map analyzers as well.
