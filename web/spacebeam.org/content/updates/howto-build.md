title: BUILD A WALL & LINGS WILL FALL

description: Now that we are training our workers, eventually we'll be running out of supply.

Players gather resources to build units and defeat their opponents. To that end, they often have worker units
(and extraction structures) that can gather resources needed to build workers, buildings, other units and research upgrades.

Workers are often also builders, and are weak in fights compared to other units.

Buldings and research define technology trees (directed acyclic graphs) and each state of a tech tree allow for the production of different unit types 
and the training of new unit abilities.

An opening denotes the same thing as in Chess: an early game plan for which the player has to make choices.

That is the case in Chess because one can move only one piece at a time (each turn), and in StarCraft because,
during the early game phase, one is economically limited and has to choose which tech paths to pursue.

Available resources constrain the technology advancement and the number of units one can produce. As producing buildings
and units also take time, the arbitrage between investing in the economy, in technological advancements, and in units production
is the crux of the strategy during the whole game.
