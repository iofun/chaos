title:  Gathering Minerals to someday Build a Refinery and extract Vespene Gas

description: Let's learn to order our workers to gather some resources closest to them!

Learn to run the game and configure bwapi.ini before we can continue!

```
cd /opt/StarCraft

wine bwheadless.exe -e /opt/StarCraft/StarCraft.exe\
-l /opt/StarCraft/bwapi-data/BWAPI.dll --host\
--name blueberry --game blueberry --race T\
--map maps/TorchUp/\\(4\\)FightingSpirit1.3.scx&\
wine Chaoslauncher/Chaoslauncher.exe
```

That is what we are actually executing, lets put it inside a little script first.

```
TBD
```

## Minerals and Vespene Gas

Minerals are a form of crystal resource. Terran and Protoss melt these minerals down to create the armored hulls of starships, behicles and personal armor. Even the `Zerg` require minerals to harder their caparaces and develop strong teeth and lungs.

Extracting minerals takes time and the specilized equipment or anatomy found on SCVs, probes and drones.

Workers mine 8 minerals per trip. Minerals are the more important of the two physical resources, for all units produces from buildings or larvae require at least some minerals to be produces, while more basic units and structures do not require `Vespene Gas`. In addition, gas harvesting is possible only by building a gas-extracting structure on a geyser (`Extractor` for `Zerg`, `Refinery` for `Terran` and `Assimilator` for `Protoss`).

### Gathering Minerals

```
TBD
```

if all went well, the workers should now start gathering the mineral patches closest to them!

```

Don't expect an optimal spread of workers, but that is left as an exercise to the reader.

## We Require More Vespone Gas

### Build a Refinery

```
TBD
```

Next we will [train different units](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/11/8-supply-11-gas-12-rax-14-scout/) to improve our Terran skills!
