description: Only meant to explore the TorchCraft Python API, not to build the best bot possible, you should probably approach your own differently!

Welcome to our tutorial for StarCraft: Brood War bots using Linux and the TorchCraft Python API; we will learn to:

1. [Setup the environment](https://spacebeam.org/2020/07/09/how-to-install-torchcraft-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-linux/)
2. Gather resources
3. Train your units
4. Build your buildings
5. Scout the enemy(s)
6. Expand on the map
7. Attack and defend

Finally we can test and deploy by:

- Test your bot using bw
- Join the [Torch Up](https://torchup.org/pages/compete/) tournament
