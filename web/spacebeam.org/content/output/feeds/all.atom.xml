Practice is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material according to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the principles of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows, therefore, that architects who have aimed at acquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority to correspond to their pains, while those who relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously hunting the shadow, not the substance. But those who have a thorough knowledge of both, like men armed at all points, have the sooner attained their object and carried authority with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are these two points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the thing signified, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that which gives it its significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; and that which gives significance is a demonstrations on scientific principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for all this are as follows. An architect must have a knowledge of drawing so that he can readily make sketches to show the appearance of the work which he proposes. Geometry, also, is of much assistance in architecture and in particular it teaches us the use of the rule and compasses, by which especially we acquire readiness in making plans for buildings in their grounds, and righly apply the square, the level, and the plummet. By means of optics, again, the light in buildings can be drawn from fixed quarters of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that by arithmetic that the total cost of buildings is calculated and measurements are computed, but difficult questions involving symmetry are solved by means of geometrical theories and methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Organizational behavior</title><link href="/organizational-behavior.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-19:/organizational-behavior.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Exactly what is an organization?

It is a building? A collection of machinery? A legal document containing a statement of incorporation? It is hardly likely to be any of these by itself. Rather, to describe an organization requires the consideration of a number of properties it possesses, thus gradually making clear, or at least clearer, that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purposes of the organization, whether it is formal or informal, are accomplished by a collection of members whose efforts or behavior are so directed that they become coordinated and integrated in order to attain sub-goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perception and behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at some point or another have had the experience of watching another person do something or behave in a certain way, saying to ourselves, "She acts as if she thought, ... " and then filling in some supposition about the way the other person looked at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple as the statement "She acts as if she thought ... " may be, it illustrates two important points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what the person thinks she sees may not actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is that people act on the basis of what they see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In understanding behavior, we must recognize that facts people do not perceive as meaningful usually will not influence their behavior, whereas the things they believe to be real, even though factually incorrect or nonexistent, will influence it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are intended to bring about integrated behavior. Similar, or at least compatible, perceptions on the part of organizational members are therefore a matter of prime consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Process of abstraction</title><link href="/process-of-abstraction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-19:/process-of-abstraction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand what is happening around us we are faced with a fundamental problem.

In approaching any situation, the system trying to understand it, does not attempt to gather all information. Instead it selects certain facts and searchers for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of some items and ignoring of others is a process of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the abstracting form a real or if you will empirical situation the things seemingly most important to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this process of abstraction and model building we deliberately select a few items, ignore may others, and then place the items chosen in a particular relationship to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so we are intentionally ignoring facts or relationships that can influence the type of situation under study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem it to select the most meaningful elements and relationships and dropout the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use abstraction skillfully know well that they neither have all the facts nor have considered all the relationships bearing on the outcome of what they are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not use the abstractions from one situation in another setting without carefully examining the fit. Neither do we expect a model to handle all aspects of a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall be dealing with many abstractions and models, not with the intention of exactly mirroring the real world but with the objective of clarifying our perception of its most essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstractions and models are mechanisms for economizing both time and effort, but like any tool they must be used within their limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model your goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the abstracted elements, a character with the flat tire begins to connect them into a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, he weaves them into a model of the confronting situation, which we can use both to understand his plight and figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of this model would probably include, among other things, the flat tire, the image of the spare in the trunk, the telephone, the service station, a forthcoming business meting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second model would contain the telephone, the service station, and the repairman there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he concludes that he will call a cab and leave his wife to deal with the flat tire as best as she can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extraordinarily elementary models, but they serve a very practical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With them the main character in our illustration can see the likely consequences of various courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out these things by doing them directly by actually handling the tire and observing that we get dirty, or by calling the repairmen and waiting for him and learning that it takes too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of big data; information models are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any given size of data, the bigger the model, the better it generalizes, provided you regularize well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is obviously true if your model is an ensemble of smaller models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding extra models to the ensemble always helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a good idea to try to make the data look small by using a big model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the model, however, we can make some reasonable predictions about what will occur and therby accept or reject the choices open to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several references have been made with the intent of this guide to provide conceptual tools for analysis. As with any other tool models, abstractions and generalizations are useful only when within their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cognitive framework</title><link href="/cognitive-framework.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-13:/cognitive-framework.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development proposes that humans cannot be given information, in which they immediately understand and use.

Instead, learners must construct their own knowledge. They build their knowledge through experience. Experiences enable them to create mental models of the world. These models are changed, enlarged, and made more sophisticated through two complimentary processes: assimilation and accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definition of intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piaget's definition of intelligence itself does not consist of an isolated cognitive process. It is not, one form of structure among others; it is the form of equilibrium towards which all the structures or cognitive processes tend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is only a generic term to indicate the equilibrium of cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believed, human beings inherit a tendency to organize their intellectual processes and to develop particular adaptations to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual adaptation is also an exchange between a person and its environment and involves the same two processes of assimilation and accommodation found in biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assimilation involves the person dealing with the environment in terms of its structures, while accommodation involves the transformation of its structures in response to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular ways in which an organism adapts and organize its processes depend also on its environment and learning history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cognitive constructivism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive constructivism is based on two different senses of construction. First, on the idea that people learn by actively constructing new knowledge, not by having information poured into their heads. Moreover, constructivism asserts that people learn with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful artifacts (e.g. computer programs, animations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;View of learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because knowledge is actively constructed, learning is presented as a process of active discovery. The role of the instructor is not to drill knowledge into students through consistent repetition, or to goad them into learning through carefully employed rewards and punishments. Rather, the role of the teacher is to facilitate discovery by providing the necessary resources and by guiding learners as they attempt to assimilate new knowledge to old and to modify the old to accommodate the new.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Undermind podcast 33</title><link href="/the-undermind-podcast-33.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-06:/the-undermind-podcast-33.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;{% youtube qYGAteZrBl8 %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to hear again from Johan de Jong the author of BananaBrain one of the top competitive protoss bots, he talked about his work around Dark Templar and Reaver/Shuttle micro as well as goin into details about his development process and path-finding fixed issues, BananaBrain was 5th in CoG 2019, Johan comment about learning strategies used in competitions raising the question about the amount of rounds available since this affects directly the learning capabilities and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Weber the author of CUNYBot is a resercher at the College of Staten Island, he is interested in macroeconomics and works with a couple of students that every few semesters make modifications, and improvements on the bot. It was interesting to hear about his experience and adventures enabling the Python interpreter inside CUNYbot and through the land mine of building the bot for competition and also enable a modern machine learning stack as well as his comments on genetic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
