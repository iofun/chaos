    <p>Not too long ago the literature of organizations consisted largely of mirrors for princess and principles of organizations; these were didactic statements which hold on certain situations and aspects of control and behavior, but in a broader sense, the term is also used to cover histories or work aimed at creating patterns for imitation or avoidance.</p>
<p>Today this is no longer the case; knowledge of organizations is incomplete, and perhaps the best we can do at preset is to use it to guide our inquiries about answers rather than as a precise tool to develop them.</p>
<p>On the surface, this shift from positive statements to qualified less precise ones might seem to be a regression, a loss of position.</p>
<p>Actually, it amounts to an enormous step forward. The simple faith in the existence of a final and ultimate answer has been replaced by a more mature and sophisticate understanding of the concurrent factors involved in organizations.</p>
<h2>Our work process</h2>
<p>We use the ZeroMQ C4 process working on nonsense.ws, which means that every change is tracked as an issue.</p>
<p>Your can define an issue for a problem and then propose your own patch, or wait for someone else to fix it... you can also come immediately with a patch, and submit that as a pull request, without a separate issue.</p>
<p>An ideal description for an issue goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem: (describe the problem here)</li>
<li>Solution: (describe your solution here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not create issues for ideas or feature requests.</p>
<p>Come with clear problems and pausible solutions.</p>
<h2>Join the community</h2>
<p>All things live on Microsoft GitHub at @nonsensews.</p>
<p>We are an open-source community with a clear focus.</p>
<p>Every project owner runs their ship as they see fit, our members jump from ship to ship over time.</p>
