Spacebeam follows its interpretation of the [UNIX](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html) philosophy: lots of small components that do one thing and talk between them by passing messages, usually text, binaries or signals.

For more about how to get involved check our StarCraft: Brood War AI [competition](https://torchup.org), explore the [guide](https://github.com/spacebeam/guide/wiki) and [community](https://spacebeam.org).

## Community
Spacebeam is a multidisciplinary open-source research & development community that conducts work on distributed systems, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.
