# control systems
-----------------
Control is one type of system.

We can find control has many of the same properties as systems in general; numerous systems interlocked in many ways.

One such way may be seen when there are hierarchies of systems paralleling progressions of goals.

There are also control systems within control systems or as we have more frequently referred to this, control loops within control loops.

Since control is also a system, it can influence other systems and in turn be influenced by them.
