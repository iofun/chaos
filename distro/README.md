# Ophelia's workspace
Spacebeam's distributed AI toolkit and workspace environment for machines of all ages.

A custom Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) x86_64 and a set of tools that manage Singularity container applications we focus on native support for Python, Lua and Erlang ecosystems unified within a quasi-opportunistic blackboard system; installation, consulting and support is also available from our community members.

## Core ideas
- Functions are a form of objects.
- Message passing and function calling are analogous.
- Asynchronous message passing is necessary for non-blocking systems.
- Selective receive allow to ignore messages uninteresting now.
