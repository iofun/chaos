# Spacebeam Linux
Spacebeam's distributed AI toolkit and workspace environment for machines of all ages.

We offer a custom Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) x86_64 and a set of tools to manage Singularity container applications we focus on native support for Python 3, Lua and Erlang ecosystems unified within a quasi-opportunistic blackboard system; installation, consulting and support is also available from community members.
